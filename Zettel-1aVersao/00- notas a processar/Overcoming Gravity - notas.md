c9: advance planning:  Here’s a quick recap
	1.There are three types of exercises: concentric, isometric, and eccentric.
	2.Exercise notation: sets × repetitions
	3.Concentric repetitions: 15 repetitions or more per exercise, stay 1 repetition short of failure, and aim for a chosen amount of repetitions for strength or hypertrophy.
	4.Use isometric charts to find your sets and hold times. Stay in the 60-70% range for holds and aim for 40-70 seconds overall.
	5.Structure eccentric exercises by systematically increasing hold time and decreasing rest time.
	6.1 Concentric repetition is approximately equivalent to a 2s isometric hold and a 3s eccentric movement.
	7.When planning the order of your routine, place the most important exercises first.
	8.Rest times per set: 30-90 seconds for endurance; 60-240 seconds for hypertrophy; 120 or 180-300+ seconds for strength.
	9.Shorten a workout by pairing exercises that do not use the same muscle groups.
	10.Tempo:10×0 tempo is standard. Changing tempo results in a different outcome for endurance, isometric work, and other exercises.
	11.In movement vs. isometric work, movement can be superior.
	12.Core work (in terms of compression) improves active flexibility. Good core exercises include ab wheel, hanging leg raises, v-ups, dragon flags, and weighted decline sit-ups (a good go-to for hypertrophy). Balance the anterior core and the posterior core.
	13.Gauge your workout performance and terminate a workout only if necessary. If it is necessary, do not feel guilty; we all have bad days.

C9: Action Plan
	- Pull out your notes and look at the exercises you have listed as the core of your routine. Begin to think about the types of repetition/set schemes you can use with them.
	- If you are fresh and have time, do a quick warm-up, followed by some maximal repetition and isometric hold testing to determine your maxes and/or competency level for each. Write them down.
	- Now figure out the repetition and set structure for each of the exercises that you will begin with in your first cycle.
	- If you already have a routine, you should know your current abilities. You may want to wait until the end of your current cycle to begin testing and implementing these protocols. However, if your current sets and repetitions are ineffective or can be improved by using the charts provided, modify your routine.





Sample Warm-Up Routine
	(Will take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete.)
	Blood Flow
		•10-20 Burpees
			Burpees are performed as follows in quick sequence: plank position → pushup → plank → move to squat position → stand → jump → squat down → move to plank position and then repeat the entire sequence.
		•60s of Crawling 
			( DIVIDE IN AS MANY SETS NEEDED)
			KEEP BACK PARALLLEL TO GRTOUND
			lift knee off floor
			focus on developing specific distance ( 25m to begin)
			Other types of full-body warm-up exercises to get your blood flowing can include: 
				rolling, 
				squatting, 
				bear walks, 
				crab walks, 
				jumping jacks, 
				jump rope, 
				short jogs, or 
				any other type of movement that is0 
					low to moderate intensity, 
					easy to perform, and 
					carries a low risk of injury.
	Mobility
		•10x Wrist Circles
		•10x Shoulder Circles
		•10x Bodyweight Squats
		•Any other body part or joint that needs to be warmed up
		•60s of Support Hold Work (using parallel bars/rings or chairs/counters)
			final target: rings-turned-out
		•5x German Hangs / Skin the Cat
		Never stretch statically for more than fifteen seconds. Stretching for longer than this may decrease your strength output during your workout. Three to four short stretches should take you about a minute
	Positional (Bodyline/Body Tension) Drills
		•30-60s of Plank, both Side Planks, Reverse Plank, Hollow, Arch Holds
	Skill Work: Time of skill work, type of skill work, and qualities
		•5-10m of Handstand Work (against the wall)
			do the work and rest as much as needed
			alt: L-sit --> V-sit and manna
		skill work is non-fatiguing movements focused on developing specific attributes, such as balance.
