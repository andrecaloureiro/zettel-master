Chapter 2... continued -- cognitive biases and heuristics

Endowment Effect
How much is your favorite coffee mug worth? Chances are you’re wrong 
because your estimation is significantly higher than the mug would be worth 
on the open market. This seems like a minor miscalculation, but the psychology underlying it can wreak havoc on your financial life. The endowment 
effect is where an individual places a higher value on an object or investment 
they already own than the value they would place on it if they did not own it. 
It is often caused by some emotional attachment to an object, or it is symbolic 
of something that is especially valuable to the owner. In some cases, the 
endowment effect occurs merely because we have the object in our possession. 
For example, Rita could purchase a painting for $500 and after owning it for a 
few years, she refuses an offer to sell the same painting for $1,000. It could be 
that Rita overvalues the object given the location of the painting in her home 
or some nostalgia that occurred in relation to the painting. The endowment 
effect is a product of loss aversion. We value what we have, particularly food, 
What Are Cognitive Biases and Heuristics? 25
water, and shelter in order to survive. In a famous experiment, researchers 
handed out mugs to half of the participants free of charge [21]. Researchers 
then asked the half who received the mugs how much they would sell the 
mugs for and the other half who did not receive the mugs how much they 
would pay for the same mugs. The group that received the mugs said they 
would sell the mugs for somewhere between $5 and $7 and the group that did 
not receive the mugs said they would buy one for only around $3, indicating 
that we tend to overvalue what we already have in our possession.
As this study illustrates, the endowment effect can lead to miscalculations of over twice the value of what someone else would pay for something in our possession. In practice, financial planners may see clients 
hold on to an investment, even though they want to sell it, because they are 
convinced that the rest of the market is undervaluing it. The endowment 
effect can also be seen in real estate transactions, where a client who claims 
they want to sell rigidly adheres to an asking price, even though the market 
has shown that the property is overpriced by a lack of interest or an offer 
of a dramatically lower amount. In a downward-moving market where the 
owner needs to sell, this can have dramatic financial consequences as the 
seller keeps dropping the price slowly, but not to the level the market has 
set. In extreme cases a seller can ride the market down 10–20% or more 
until they finally come to their senses and sell at actual market value.
Financial planners can help clients counter the endowment effect in several ways. First, they can educate their clients about the effect prior to discussing whatever financial decision is at hand. Utilizing stories of past clients 
(changing names and details to ensure anonymity) or studies such as the one 
just discussed, can be helpful in this regard. Second, they can ask their clients to imagine life without the possession or investment. Would their lives 
be seriously harmed by not having the item in their lives? This process can 
help the client to evaluate the item more objectively. Third, when it comes to 
investing, the endowment effect tends to be most exaggerated with inexperienced investors. As clients gain experience (and the losses that can come 
from the endowment effect), they can actively work to avoid overvaluing 
their investments. Financial planners can continue to remind clients of past 
experiences that can help them examine their investments more objectively.
Familiarity Bias
We have spent most of human history in hunter-gatherer tribes without the 
benefit of the scientific method. We had to learn by trial and error, which was 
often quite dangerous. An unfamiliar plant or mushroom could have led to 
26 Chapter 2 Behavioral Finance Understanding Cognitive Biases 
either a delicious meal or poisoning and death. As a result, it’s likely that 
many of our ancestors who favored the unfamiliar were less likely to pass 
down their genes. Better to just stick with familiar foods than risk one’s life, 
right? Additionally, being around unfamiliar faces often meant exposure to 
new diseases and/or violence. As such, it makes perfect sense why we have 
evolved to favor the familiar and be wary about the unfamiliar.
Familiarity bias can cause us to favor known quantities over what is new, 
novel, or less well known. When current situations appear similar to previous 
situations, we tend to regress to whatever state of mind we had previously 
held. For example, in evaluating numerous applications for an open employment position, a manager might favor applicants who graduated from the 
same alma mater the manager did. In many cases, familiarity bias occurs 
when an individual is experiencing a high amount of cognitive load or is 
stressed. In this case, the manager may be overwhelmed with applicants so 
this familiarity can help them in sorting through the resumes. In terms of 
investing, it is not uncommon to see portfolios that are overweighted with 
stocks from well-known companies, even when lesser-known companies 
may be better investments at any given time. Residents of countries all over 
the world have a tendency to hold portfolios that are overweighted with 
domestic investments, and it’s common for employees of publicly held companies to be overconcentrated with their company’s stock in their 401(k)s. 
Investing in something we are familiar with can make us feel more at ease 
even though it may be placing us at great risk due to a lack of diversification.
Flat Rate Bias
Flat rate bias is a customer preference to pay a flat rate as opposed to a payper-use approach, even when the costs are equal to or greater than the actual 
usage. Companies of all types utilize this approach with customers. Studies 
have found that even purchasing professionals fall prey to this bias, even 
when pay-per-use options are cheaper [22].
Gambler’s Fallacy
Also called the Monte Carlo fallacy, the gambler’s fallacy refers to the erroneous thinking that an event is more or less likely to happen based on previous 
events. Given its name, this phenomenon is most common in casinos, where 
individuals will assume that a roll of a dice will go a certain way because it did 
or did not in previous rolls. The gambler’s fallacy has been observed in 
What Are Cognitive Biases and Heuristics? 27
laboratory settings as well as in real-life gambling scenarios. For example, after 
gamblers experience a streak of five or more occurrences, they place significantly more bets on that occurrence happening a sixth time versus it not 
happening [23].
Law of Small Numbers Bias
Tversky and Kahneman are credited with first describing the law of small 
numbers bias [24], which is when someone makes sweeping generalizations about a group based on the behaviors or other qualities of one or a 
small handful of people. Sometimes referred to as “painting with a broad 
brush,” this bias tends to manifest itself in groups that have different identities of sorts. For example, people of one race, gender, or ethnic group can be 
susceptible to the law of small numbers bias if they are exposed to only a 
small number of individuals who differ from them in some way, 
shape, or form.
Loss Aversion
“The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat.” This unforgettable statement from 
the opening of the Wide World of Sports TV show perfectly sums up loss aversion
bias. People hate to lose more than they love to win. Our brains are wired to 
seek pleasure and avoid pain [11]. The psychological pain of losing something 
is twice as powerful as the joy from winning something of the same value [25]. 
In finance, when we don’t want to admit to taking a loss because it’s too painful, 
we may hold on to an investment longer than we should. Holding on to a losing 
investment inevitably leads to even more loss and more pain. This is also common in failing business ventures, which we describe soon in greater detail as 
the sunk cost fallacy [26]. It is difficult for people to part with something when 
they’ve invested a large amount of time, energy, money, and resources into it.
It is natural to want to avoid loss, shame, guilt, embarrassment, or grief. 
But in trying to dodge the pain, many entrepreneurs will wind up going 
down with the ship. They’ll sell off assets, withdraw from their retirement 
plans, and go down a spiral of repeatedly borrowing money to keep a failing 
enterprise afloat. Studies on the psychology of wealth have shown that 
ultrawealthy people have less of a tendency toward loss aversion than those 
in the middle class [4]. The ultrawealthy are more willing to admit when an 
investment has failed and are more readily able to cut their losses sooner, 
28 Chapter 2 Behavioral Finance Understanding Cognitive Biases 
preventing the losses from continuing to hurt their portfolios so they can 
recover more quickly. It may help clients to understand the tendencies of the 
ultrawealthy so they can work to adopt a similar mindset and avoid the pitfalls of loss aversion.
Mental Accounting
Imagine a woman who just won the lottery. She was a frugal saver before the 
lottery winnings, with an account for her child’s college fund, a grocery 
budget, and a little bit set aside for retirement. Instead of investing or saving 
her winnings, she goes on a cruise, buys a bunch of expensive clothes, dines 
at the finest restaurants, and blows all her winnings in a matter of a few 
years. She squanders her lottery winnings because she put them in a category 
of “throwaway money.” She kept all her hard-earned money, but the lottery 
jackpot was money she never intended to have and didn’t work to earn. 
Therefore, she placed a different value on those winnings. It was easier for 
her to part with them. This person isn’t necessarily bad with money, she is 
just up against a common cognitive bias called mental accounting. This 
behavioral economics concept was first introduced by Nobel Prize–winning 
economist Richard Thaler [27]. It points out that people tend to place different values on money based on biased criteria, often to detrimental effect [28].
Mental accounting also comes into play with credit cards. In 2020, Americans owed $73 billion in credit card debt. It is much easier for a person to 
throw down a credit card to pay for something than to withdraw from savings 
or keep track of how much they can spend in a checking account. Funds 
from a credit card may feel like “free money,” because people may not be paying attention to the interest they are paying on their balance. Some find they 
are paying hundreds of dollars each month in interest fees, money that could 
go into a savings account and earn interest.
People are prone to categorizing money differently, even though the 
value of money doesn’t change. They put money in mental buckets based on 
ideas – often irrational. One bucket might be for bills. Another bucket could 
be a general savings account. A different bucket might be for retirement, but 
since that seems far away, many people ignore that bucket and leave it empty 
for much too long. The general savings account bucket is problematic because 
there is no specific purpose for it. Anytime something comes up, whether it 
is a car repair, a big birthday celebration, or a vacation, it’s all too easy to dip 
into that general savings fund.
In some circumstances, mental accounting can be harnessed for our 
financial benefit. For example, if a person were to label a savings account 
What Are Cognitive Biases and Heuristics? 29
specifically, such as “Jasmine’s College Savings Fund,” it would be harder to 
justify pulling from that savings to go on vacation. Similarly, a client may 
choose to open a separate savings account labeled “Italy 2030” to motivate 
them to save for a family vacation. The more specific a person gets with labeling their subaccounts, the higher their success will be in achieving their 
saving goals, and the less likely they will be to withdraw from the accounts 
for unexpected emergencies or frivolous spending [11]. It’s a good idea to 
encourage clients to imagine themselves succeeding in their goal. If they 
have a plain “vacation” fund with no real destination in mind, they will be 
less motivated to save. But if they imagine themselves seaside, eating delicious pasta at a beautiful Italian restaurant, they will save with enthusiasm 
and stay committed to the goal.
Another way financial planners can use mental accounting for a client’s 
benefit is by presenting the performance of investments in different categories, represented in different graphs. For example, a client’s portfolio could 
be divided into two buckets: 50% in equities and 50% in fixed income. In the 
event of a market downturn, a client might benefit from seeing these asset 
classes displayed as two separate bars in a graph. While seeing news of a 
market drop of 20%, represented by their equity allocation, they may take 
comfort in seeing the fixed income portion of their investments down by 
only 2%. The planner might use mental accounting to remind their client 
that if needed, they could draw from the fixed income portion of the portfolio 
for years before they would need to tap into the equity portion, giving it time 
to recover.
Overconfidence
Most people have been guilty of overconfidence at one time or another. It is 
human nature to overestimate our abilities and our level of control over a 
given situation. According to a study by AAA, 8 out of 10 male drivers consider their driving abilities to be above average [29]. Statistically speaking, 
this is quite unlikely. It would suggest that many, many above average drivers 
are crashing into one another yearly. So why do we tend to overestimate our 
abilities? One explanation is a cognitive error called the illusion of control. 
This term was originally introduced by Ellen Langer in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology [30]. Langer explained that people have a common instinct to overestimate their role in successful outcomes and to 
downplay their part in failures. People don’t like to believe that chance has 
anything to do with it because the lack of control makes human beings 
uncomfortable.
30 Chapter 2 Behavioral Finance Understanding Cognitive Biases 
The illusion of control is a factor in financial decision-making as well. 
One prime example of this phenomena’s influence in finance is in cryptocurrency trading. The illusion of control is a dominant feature in those who 
engage in crypto trading, day trading, and sports betting [31]. For cryptocurrency traders with a propensity toward the illusion of control, favorable market conditions will only reinforce this illusion of control, which may 
contribute to greater risk taking. As the market drops, due to their tendency 
to downplay their role in failures while overestimating their role in any success owing to a favorable market, they risk losing their whole investment. 
The more time and effort people put into picking a stock, the more they 
believe they have insight for predicting the future of that stock as well as the 
direction of the entire stock market [11]. The illusion of control leads to overconfidence in investing insight and abilities, which could cause financial 
ruin. Advisors can help address this overconfidence by discussing the limited 
control that comes from things like crypto trading and sports betting. Lecturing your client is not advisable but helping them gain a longer-term view can 
potentially open their eyes to the lack of control they actually have with their 
money when investing in activities where the outcome has little rhyme 
or reason.
Persuasion Bias
Persuasion bias describes our susceptibility to making decisions based on 
social influence and the repetition of information. Specifically, it describes 
the phenomenon by which we fail to fully account for the impact of information we hear repeatedly on the formation of our beliefs and behaviors [32]. 
Whether the information is right or wrong, the more we hear it the more 
likely we are to believe it. This helps explain the powerful impacts of social 
media, marketing, airtime, and even censorship on the impact of belief formation and behaviors. The impact of persuasion bias is linked to social influence, where the people who have the most airtime and reach in a particular 
social network are able to exert the most influence.
Recency Effect
The recency effect is the tendency to best remember the information that was 
presented last. The most common example of the recency effect is memorizing a list that was presented verbally. Attorneys focus largely on the recency 
effect as they plan their closing arguments to a jury. In terms of investing, a 
What Are Cognitive Biases and Heuristics? 31
recency bias plays out when investors incorporate more recent events into 
their decision making around investing, even when past events may be more 
important in understanding the wisdom of the decision [32].
Regret Aversion
The fear of regret can be crippling. Many of our cognitive biases reveal that 
our brains just don’t like to feel the effects of negative outcomes. Regret aversion is another example of the brain trying to protect us from the bad feelings 
of regret [33]. This bias can prevent a client from making a decision for fear 
that it will be the wrong one. Regret-averse people also regret taking no 
action at all. It’s a double-edged sword. Loss-aversion bias, which we discussed previously, causes people to focus more on avoiding making bad decisions than on trying to make good decisions. Regret aversion isn’t all bad. It 
helps us make lifestyle changes, for instance, when the doctor recommends 
cutting down on fatty foods and exercising to bring down cholesterol. It can 
also be used to motivate clients to save more for their futures so they don’t 
regret retiring without a proper nest egg. But when regret aversion freezes a 
client from making decisions or taking action, it can be helpful to discuss 
acceptance with clients. Research shows that people tend to overestimate the 
weight of future regret [34]. Practicing acceptance of outcomes and understanding the natural human tendency to overestimate regret can help clients 
get over the hurdle of regret aversion [35]. To a certain degree, regret aversion is healthy and keeps us from making bad decisions. As long as it is properly managed, rather than a hindrance, it can be an asset, in financial planning.
Representativeness Heuristic
A representative heuristic is when we tend to label something because of its 
connection to a larger group with similar characteristics. For example, investors may conflate a successful company with being a successful investment. 
As we know, those are two very different categories within a given period of 
time, but because they are based on the identity of one company, it is common to conflate reputation and investment. Representativeness can impact 
our investing decisions in other ways, too. For example, researchers at a brokerage firm looking at 40,000 households found that investors preferred 
stocks that had recently had abnormally large positives, suggesting that they 
thought these recent returns were representative of future returns [36].
32 Chapter 2 Behavioral Finance Understanding Cognitive Biases 
Salience Bias
Psychologists in the 1970s found that one’s literal point of view in observing 
social interactions has an influence on how others are perceived [37]. Specifically, when we are watching two people talk, we ascribe more causality in the 
interaction to the person whose face we are seeing than to the person for 
whom we can only see the back of their head. This cognitive bias has since 
been called salience bias.
Salience bias is our tendency to focus on the information that is most 
vivid and in our face. For example, when consumer sentiment news is 
reported, it can have a disproportionate impact on more salient, well-known 
stocks given the attention of news reports and analysts [38]. The problem 
with salience bias is that even though what is grabbing our attention may be 
the most poignant, it is often not the most important. This is why financial 
planners will often encourage clients to not spend excessive time watching 
the ups and downs of the markets. For example, news that stocks are on a 
tear may be exciting, but it is often irrelevant to the client’s financial plan. 
Instead, acting on that information could go against their best interests.
Status Quo Bias
We’re all lazy. It is okay to admit it. It’s in our ancestral programming. When 
presented with the opportunity, our brains will seek out the path of least 
resistance every time. Long ago, laziness was a tool of survival. Due to our 
primitive instinct to conserve energy and avoid exertion, we typically prefer 
to apply the least amount of physical and mental effort in any task [11]. In 
cognitive psychology, this tendency is referred to as the status quo bias. For 
example, chances are you’ve had the same cell service for several years and 
even though you complain about the occasional dropped calls, high fees, and 
limited customer service, you stick with the same carrier. You see advertisements for other services that offer financial incentives to change, but it is 
easier and simpler to just stick with the company you already are using.
The status quo bias served our ancestors well. They struggled to survive 
in scarcity, not knowing when or where they would get their next meal. By 
conserving their energy, they could stretch the sustenance from their latest 
feast as far as possible. However, in modern society, the status quo bias isn’t 
necessary for humans to survive. We live in an age where food comes to our 
doors at the tap of a button. Instead of hunting for woolly mammoths, many 
What Are Cognitive Biases and Heuristics? 33
people sit at their desks for most of the day. The status quo bias has become 
something we must often override to do what is best for us.
Exercising is an example of a way human beings must override this 
inherent bias to conserve energy. It takes a conscious effort to overcome our 
laziness and build a healthy habit of physical fitness in our modern world. 
Ancient humans would probably laugh and sneer at modern-day people, 
needlessly running in circles, lifting weights, or rowing a boat that goes 
nowhere. But with the rise of obesity and heart disease, it is necessary to our 
survival for us to exercise. The tables have turned. Now human beings must 
fight against the laziness instinct and make it a priority to get to the gym.
Human beings are also genetically programmed to conserve mental 
energy. We have a list of cognitive shortcuts we use every day to exert the 
least amount of mental energy as possible. One of these shortcuts is to stick 
with the status quo, hence the term status quo bias. Our natural tendency is 
to keep things the same. Don’t rock the boat. Anyone who has ever tried to 
break a habit knows the power of this tendency. The human brain prefers to 
stick with the known rather than the unknown, the familiar over the unfamiliar, with outcomes on which it can rely, whether healthy or not. It’s easier 
to just keep doing things the way we’ve always done them.
Sunk-Cost Fallacy
Have you ever stayed in a relationship too long? Deep down you knew it 
wasn’t going to work but you kept putting off its end. After all, they knew 
your friends, they had your favorite hoodie, and your parents even liked 
them. You knew it was over but who wants to go through the drama? Admitting to yourself, to them, and to the world that it was a bad relationship was 
hard, and you weren’t looking forward to the smug look from your best friend 
who had been telling you your partner wasn’t good for you. Perhaps you even 
made up some excuses like “I can’t end it now, it’s their birthday next month” 
to delay the inevitable.
The sunk-cost fallacy is our tendency to follow through on something 
even though the costs outweigh the benefits [33]. In financial planning, this 
often manifests as difficulty in letting go of a bad investment or a failed business into which one has put their valuable time, energy, or money, regardless of whether the current costs outweigh the benefits. In many cases, the 
decision to continue with an experience or investment goes against any evidence that suggests that following through is the best decision. It is 
34 Chapter 2 Behavioral Finance Understanding Cognitive Biases 
irrational to consider irrecoverable costs in making a present decision. For 
example, Bryant prepaid a dinner for him and his partner for Valentine’s 
Day at a local restaurant. Halfway through the meal, the couple was not having a good time as the restaurant environment was loud and uncomfortable. 
Instead of leaving, Bryant insisted they stay since he had already paid for the 
experience. Neither staying nor departing was going to recoup the invested 
money in the dinner, but the couple was investing more time in an experience that they were not enjoying. Organizations are also susceptible to the 
sunk-cost fallacy when they invest in projects that go over budget or even 
lose their desired objectives partway through the project. Due to their already 
committed resources, they follow through despite the costs or potential impact.
Financial planners can help their clients avoid the sunk-cost fallacy by 
first keeping track of resources that have been invested and the necessary 
resources needed to finish whatever investment or experience they are 
engaged in. Perhaps most importantly, planners can continue to remind their 
clients of the big picture and how continuing on the same path may impact 
their short- and long-term goals.
THE ROLE OF THE FINANCIAL PLANNER
Financial planners can help limit the negative impact of cognitive biases. 
To be most effective, the planner must continue to listen and help the client 
better identify their biases and, perhaps most importantly, take some of the 
emotion out of their financial plan. Bringing objectivity to the conversation 
is critical. The planner can work to develop an environment that not only 
eliminates friction in helping the client act in their own best interests, but 
even capitalizes on some of these cognitive biases to be used for the client’s 
benefit, such as the strategic use of mental accounting to ease anxiety in 
the midst of market turmoil or to increase a client’s motivation to save 
toward a meaningful goal. Financial planners can also create an environment in which there is open dialogue, allowing the planner to identify 
some of the biases a client may exhibit. With this in mind planners can 
proactively inoculate clients against many of these biases by open discussion and education around how human beings are wired to do money 
wrong – especially in times of heightened emotion. Introducing these conversations early in the relationship can facilitate the creation of a shared 
language and make it easier to refer to them when the biases rear their 
ugly head.
Eliminate the Friction 35
ELIMINATE THE FRICTION
One way we can counter our laziness, whether at the gym or mentally, is by 
eliminating the friction that makes it more difficult for us to do the things 
that are in our best interests. For example, people who go to a gym five times 
a month have an average commute of 3.7 miles, whereas those who only 
went to the gym once a week had an average commute of 5.1  miles [39]. 
There is less friction, in this case a commute, for people to get to the gym to 
exercise. Many online retailers do an incredible job of making purchasing as 
easy and frictionless as possible. No reentering credit card numbers or even 
selecting what to buy! Their system knows what you purchased before and 
with one or two clicks, the product is back at your door and your money is on 
its way to the CEO of the retailer! Frictionless. We can alter our environment 
to eliminate the friction to help us do the things that are going to make us 
happier and healthier.
Since human beings have an innate desire to keep things the same, how 
can we increase the possibility for success in helping our clients meet their 
financial goals? One way to address the status quo bias is to use that instinctual 
laziness to the benefit of the client by eliminating the friction and making doing 
the right thing as easy as possible. For instance, let’s say that a client wants to 
invest more into their retirement. By engaging a financial planner, they have 
taken the first step in overriding their status quo bias and are excited about taking action to achieve their goal. The client has decided how much they want to 
contribute each month. The worst thing a financial planner can do is to establish a system in which the client must write a check or transfer money into an 
account every month. This requires too much effort for the ancestral brain. The 
client will inevitably forget to make the transfer, or when something unexpected comes up that requires extra money (and something always comes up), 
it will be too easy to stop contributing. A more successful strategy is harnessing 
the status quo bias and automating the contributions. Whether this is through 
autotransfers the client sets up ahead of time or salary deferrals that occur without the client thinking about it, this method will short-circuit the cognitive bias 
to keep everything the same and resist extra effort. When a client automates 
contributions, they will need to make a conscious effort to sabotage their saving 
and investing goals. Stopping the contributions will require extra mental energy 
and complex processes, which we know the brain hates. Automation will help 
the client harness the power of their mental laziness, therefore serving their 
financial well-being for the long term [39]. In modern society, we need to outsmart our cognitive biases and get them working in our favor, rather than 
36 Chapter 2 Behavioral Finance Understanding Cognitive Biases 
against us. The status quo bias is just one of many that can hold a financial 
planning client back.
TECHNIQUES FOR OVERCOMING BIASES
Soll, Milkman, and Payne offer techniques that can help financial planners 
and clients overcome their cognitive biases in three areas important to decision making: (1) thinking about the future, (2) thinking about objectives, and 
(3) thinking about options [40].
Thinking About the Future
1. Make three estimates. When trying to make predictions about the 
future, the price of a particular stock, for example, try to come up with 
three estimates: low, medium, and high. Coming up with three numbers can help you compensate for being overly optimistic or pessimistic. Often the middle number will be the closest to reality.
2. Think twice. Another hedge against poor decisions is to make two 
guesses. Make your first guess, set it aside, and then come back later 
and make another guess without referring to your first. Then average them out.
3. Use postmortems. In a twist on thinking through a failure, Soll et. al 
(2015) encourage people to imagine a future failure and then deconstruct (ahead of time) what went wrong. This approach can help curb 
excessive optimism and help you come up with a backup plan.
4. Take an outside view. Try to view the situation from an outside perspective, such as if you were going to advise a friend on how to proceed.
Thinking About Objectives
1. Cycle through your objectives. Once you have made a list of your goals, 
spend some time looking at each one of them individually and 
develop a plan for meeting that goal rather than approaching them 
all as one.
2. Seek advice. This is where financial advisors play such a critical role. 
Once you have a clear idea of your goals, seek objective advice from 
others to help expand your point of view.


CHAPTER 3
Consider two professionals sitting at a conference table. While they are in the 
same place now, dressed similarly and perhaps even working for the same 
firm, they come from two very different backgrounds. One grew up wealthier 
than the other; they are of different races; and one experienced psychological 
trauma that the other didn’t. If you were their financial advisor, would you 
want to approach your relationship with them in the exact same manner? 
Without working to better understand their clients’ backgrounds, many 
planners could make a number of erroneous assumptions based on their initial behaviors or appearance in your first meeting. Given their different backgrounds, how might their priorities and worries differ? Could there be 
potential triggers that might elicit some emotion in one of them but not the 
other? What assumptions might you make about their worldviews based on 
their appearance, dress, or demeanor? Between any two clients, we can see 
these dramatic differences in backgrounds and life experiences manifest 
throughout the financial planning process. There are a variety of strategies a 
planner can use to help build a solid, trusting relationship with clients and to 
help them meet their financial goals. But before we dive into the strategies 
it’s important to understand our clients and how their environment has 
impacted their financial psychology.
We are immersed in an environment that shapes our thinking and experiences around money. The impact of this environment can be extremely difficult to see from the outside. In some cases, we are like fish swimming in a 
pond. Until we are exposed to other bodies of water, we think our pond is 
“just how the world is.” Our fundamental subconscious assumptions, 

![[Attachments/Pasted image 20231115132109.png]]

without disconfirming evidence, will be that other people are having similar 
thoughts, feelings, and experiences as we are.
Mark Twain touched on this notion when he spoke of the benefits of 
traveling: “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and 
many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, 
charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one 
little corner of the earth all one’s lifetime” [41]. In this chapter we focus on 
the impact of our environment shaping our financial psychology, as illustrated in Figure 3.1.
ENVIRONMENT: CULTURE, GENERATION, CLASS, 
AND COMMUNITY
Our environment has the power to impact everything we say, do, feel, or 
think, often without our even being consciously aware of it. As the famous 
psychologist B.F. Skinner once wrote: “I did not direct my life. I didn’t design 
it. I never made decisions. Things always came up and made them for me. 
That’s what life is.”
Although many of Skinner’s conclusions have been challenged in the 
decades following his work on operant conditioning, there is a great deal of 
truth to his assertion that our environments have a powerful impact on
shaping all aspects of our lives. Our environment directly influences our 
beliefs about money. It plays an enormous role in developing our sense of 
normalcy, influenced by our country, state, city, neighborhood, religion, culture, socioeconomic background, and whether we grew up in a rural or urban 
environment. These can all be key factors in determining the nature of our 
relationship with money. While some environments nurture positive money 
habits and outcomes, others can be destructive. A person’s money beliefs and 
financial behaviors may be based on false narratives and inaccurate information. We need to understand the environment a client experienced as a child 
if we want to help them overcome any inaccurate or destructive beliefs, habits, or tendencies they may have. Aspects of their environment worthy of 
consideration include their culture, generation, socioeconomic class, and 
community.
Culture
The culture in which we are immersed has a tremendous impact on our 
relationship with money. Being raised in a particular country, being a member of a particular ethnic group, adhering to specific religious beliefs and 
practices, and being raised according to established gender norms all have a 
profound impact on our financial experiences and resulting beliefs. Our 
majority or minority status in any or all of those groups also impacts our 
experiences. We explore the impact of majority and minority status on 
financial planning in detail in Chapter  15. Cultural norms and values 
impact, for example, how much an individual experiences a desire, or external pressure, to share their financial resources with their families and communities. Going against that culture could result in banishment, similar to 
the times of our hunter-gatherer ancestors. While we would not likely die 
from being exiled from our families or communities today, our brain still 
believes that banishment equals death. It can be challenging for a person to 
go against the culture in which they were raised, and a financial planner 
must take care in honoring a person’s cultural values in the development of 
a financial plan.
If you’re a practicing financial planner, what is the makeup of your current clients when it comes to culture? What backgrounds do your clients 
emanate? Do you work with clients from different backgrounds? This book 
dives deeper into ways to engage clients from a broad range of cultural backgrounds. The people with whom we work and spend our free time can help 
us see the world through a different lens.
Generation
Given that cultures shift over time, the generation in which we are born can 
also have a profound impact on our experiences. Norms and values shift over 
time and entire generations experience events that can shape their approach 
to money. For example, the Great Depression was accompanied for many by 
scarcity, and a lingering penchant for frugality. The Great Recession resulted 
in a generation of young people who had less trust in the stable value of real 
estate and the stock market. While people in a particular culture and generation may experience these differently, the environment in which one is 
immersed will impact their financial behaviors.
The average age of a financial planner is 55 years old, with approximately 
one-fifth of the workforce at over 65 [42]. What is the average age of the advisors in your firm? What is the average age of the clients in the firm and are 
you looking to attract younger clients? Conversely, are you a younger planner 
(or still in school studying to become one) and looking to discover avenues to 
connect with older clients? It is important to consider generational influences on a client’s values, goals, beliefs, and behaviors.
Socioeconomic Class
A person’s socioeconomic status while they were growing up also heavily 
impacts their views and behaviors around money. For example, climbing the 
socioeconomic ladder comes with challenges. When one member of the family becomes wealthy or successful, it can make them feel alienated from their 
family, especially if that family is poor. Instead of offering support and 
encouragement, the wealthy family member may feel estranged, disparaged, 
or used because of constant requests for financial support and loans that may 
never be repaid. Sometimes the wealthy family members will subconsciously 
sabotage themselves just to feel like they belong within their tribe. Psychologically, there is a strong pull to stay at the same socioeconomic level as the 
rest of the family. So they may give away their money or lose it all in bad 
investments, just so they don’t have to feel the sting of the family’s hostility 
and estrangement [11].
Social Exchange Theory
A greater understanding of shared tribal bonds can be gathered from the 
perspective of the social exchange theory, which asserts that there is a human 
Environment: Culture, Generation, Class, and Community 43
tendency to seek a natural balance between give and take [43]. In order for 
tribal relationships to be worthwhile, each member must feel they are receiving value that is equal to or greater than the amount they sacrifice and/or 
invest in the tribe. If the balance is off, if resentment and discontent fester, 
the individual’s bond with the tribe can be harmed. For instance, if one 
member of the tribe contributes significantly less than other members, they 
risk banishment. On the other hand, if one member is giving significantly 
more than the rest of the tribe, they may begin to feel bitter, taken advantage 
of, or held back from their full potential. In the latter instance, the individual 
may find a new tribe that aligns more closely with their values. As a planner, 
it is crucial to understand the cultural dynamic at play in a client’s life in 
order to navigate the sometimes-choppy waters of family and community 
relationships. Chapter 6 covers how to learn about a client’s cultural background, discover how much they are influenced by it, and navigate that 
sometimes tricky territory so they can make the best financial decisions possible.
Community
Being from a small town in a rural area can lead to very different experiences 
around money than while growing up in a larger town. One could argue that 
being exposed to a larger worldview could provide a more diverse environment that can influence and shape our belief systems. Regardless of where 
you live today, the rise of social media has widened our exposure to other 
ways of being. Instead of growing up in small communities, we are now 
exposed to lifestyles of people from all different classes, cultures, and levels 
of wealth. Our modern world went from keeping up with the Joneses to 
keeping up with the Kardashians. People flaunt their wealth on social media, 
making a person of average means and a more humble upbringing feel inadequate. Individuals see the curated posts of the people they follow on Instagram or Facebook and feel compelled to achieve the same, not realizing that 
so many create images of themselves that are only loosely based on the reality of their lives. This creates feelings of FOMO and inadequacy even though 
people are measuring themselves against something that may not even exist! 
This inadequacy gives rise to people living beyond their means, hiking up 
credit card debt to buy the latest fashions and gadgets, and neglecting things 
like savings and retirement. The environment of social media has had a 
major impact on society’s financial beliefs, values, and behaviors. If a client 
wants to make sound financial choices, who they follow on social media may 
44 Chapter 3 The Environment
be just as important as where they were born and raised. Following people on 
social media who can empower and motivate you toward your goals can be 
far more helpful than devoting attention to people who only make us crave 
more things that we may not even want in the first place!
WHAT’S NEXT
When a financial planner is in a room or in a virtual meeting with a client, 
they are not just facing the client. They are dealing with generational messages, ancestral programming, cognitive biases, and influences from their 
culture, gender, the socioeconomic status in which they were raised, their 
financial flashpoints, money beliefs, and their financial outcomes to date. 
There is a lot to unpack. But with the proper tools and a knowledge of psychology, a planner can help clients to understand their own biases, tendencies, beliefs, behaviors, and habits. Once the planner and client share an 
understanding of the intricacies at play in the client’s financial life, they’ll be 
able to harness those factors and use them to propel the client toward achieving their financial goals.

Part II - understanding clients Financial Psychology

UNDERSTANDING 
A CLIENT’S FINANCIAL 
PSYCHOLOGY
As we’ve discussed, when a financial planner is meeting with a client, they 
are not just facing the client, they are dealing with a host of generational and 
cultural messages, biases, and influences, the outcomes of which they may 
or may not be aware. In Part I we explored why human beings are naturally 
wired to be bad with money and the impact of the broader environment on 
their financial psychology. But these universal human tendencies are just 
part of the financial psychology story. Our financial psychology is also influenced by individual factors. Our experiences around money, beliefs about 
money, and our financial behaviors all help shape our relationship with 
money. We have unique individual, family, and generational experiences 
around money, which we refer to as financial flashpoints. To make sense of 
these experiences, we develop beliefs around money, which we refer to as 
money scripts®. These beliefs, in turn, influence our financial behaviors and 
outcomes. Our financial outcomes give us new financial flashpoints, and the 
cycle continues.
In Part II we explore the intersection of financial flashpoints, money 
scripts, and financial behaviors in shaping our financial psychology. We dedicate a chapter to each of these topics. Utilizing our model of financial psychology (Figure II.1), our hope is that you are able to better make sense of the 
individual factors impacting a client’s relationship with money

Financial Background
50 Chapter 4 Exploring a Client’s Financial Background
he was six years old, gaining the praise and approval of his mother and everyone in town. Ted remembers his father having several jobs and always 
working. From this story, Ted absorbed the idea that being called lazy was the 
worst thing someone could say about a person.
As he got older, Ted also worked harder, always focused on proving that he 
wasn’t lazy rather than being paid appropriately for his labor. He often worked 
on his maternal grandfather’s farm baling hay. One day, at 10 years old, Ted 
mustered up the courage to ask his grandfather if he would be willing to pay 
him one dollar per day for his work. He knew that his grandfather paid other 
neighborhood boys a dollar per hour for doing the same work. He also knew 
his grandfather would never give him a dollar per hour but thought maybe a 
dollar a day would be reasonable. His grandfather’s words became the guiding 
principle of his life for the next 30 years. He said, “I will decide whether or not 
I think you’re worth anything, and if I do, I’ll pay you. You should feel lucky 
that you have something to eat, a place to sleep, and clothes to wear.” Ted never 
got a cent from his grandfather. At every job he worked after that, for the next 
35 years, Ted let other people decide what he was worth and what he 
should be paid.
Our financial psychology is forged through our experiences, and the 
environment, culture, and socioeconomic situation in which we live. 
Traumatic experiences as they relate to money can also impact our financial psychology. When examining a client’s financial behaviors, it can be 
helpful to first learn about their financial beliefs, digging deeper to find the 
source of these stories, and deciding together whether these beliefs are 
serving the client or causing harm to their financial lives. The source of 
many of our clients’ beliefs are their financial flashpoints, which consist of 
their specific background and experiences around money. Financial flashpoints can be unique events experienced by the individual and/or family – 
such as a job loss or bankruptcy – or a universal societal event, such as the 
Great Recession or Great Depression. As illustrated in Figure 4.1, financial 
flashpoints lead to the development of our money scripts. These events 
shape our financial psychology and our subsequent financial behaviors 
and outcomes. Our financial behaviors and outcomes, in turn, give us a 
new set of financial flashpoint experiences – whether positive or negative – 
that either reinforce our money scripts or give us opportunities to challenge and change them.
The purpose of this chapter is to build on the factors that influence our 
perceptions and behaviors and focus on how our unique experiences around 
money shape our financial beliefs.

[figure 4.1]

FINANCIAL FLASHPOINTS
Ted’s experiences around money, from watching his father get praised for 
hard work to his grandfather telling him he wasn’t good enough to get 
paid, represent his financial flashpoints, which shaped his money beliefs 
and his own work-related behaviors. Financial flashpoints are life events 
(or a series of events) associated with money that are so emotionally powerful that they leave an imprint that lasts into adulthood [44, p. 8]. This 
imprint has an impact on our beliefs, attitudes, and relationship with 
money.
Financial flashpoints could be specific to a person’s family situation, culture, or cultural or societal events, such as the Great Depression or the housing market crash. Flashpoints can also occur from the socioeconomic status 
in which an individual was raised, their religion, their majority or minority 
status, and even gender. For instance, parents are still bringing their male 
children into financial conversations and situations – such as requiring them 
to work outside the home – before their female children. This causes female 
children to be behind in learning about things like balancing a checkbook, 
budgeting, and saving. All of these factors lay fertile ground for financial 
flashpoints early in a person’s life. Some financial flashpoints can be traumatic, which, if left unchecked or unchallenged, can cause a client to make

poor financial decisions that could harm their financial future. Other flashpoints could be a bit more mundane, but still have a powerful impact on 
a person’s life. It is imperative that the financial planner work to develop a 
deeper relationship with the client to uncover any of these potential barriers 
and experiences that can dramatically impact a client’s view on money. We 
explore several approaches to eliciting these stories from clients in financial 
planning later in this chapter.
Growing Up Poor
Growing up poor is often a traumatic experience, one of scarcity and fear that 
there will never be enough to survive, impacting people’s beliefs about money 
and their financial outcomes. It is a logical conclusion for someone who 
grew up in poverty and, at their core, assumes that there will not be enough. 
A scarcity mindset can have a powerful impact on so many aspects of our 
lives, from our money to relationships to time. Essentially, the experience of 
scarcity leads to scarcity beliefs, which unfortunately lead to more scarcity. 
When people grow up believing there is not enough money, they can go in 
two radically different directions:
1. A person becomes a saver and a hustler. This individual works
exceptionally hard so they don’t fall back into poverty. These types of
individuals often accrue significant amounts of money and make up
a significant percentage of financial planning clients. Many become
avid savers and manage their personal finances well. Ironically, in
trying to avoid a life of scarcity, many wind up living a life of subjective scarcity and anxiety around money. Often these clients struggle
to retire or begin to take distributions from their accounts.
2. A person will fall into a pit of learned helplessness. This is a psychological condition that causes people to think that no matter what
they do, it doesn’t matter. In a series of experiments using electric
shocks on dogs, psychologist Martin Seligman found that when experiencing uncontrollable and inescapable trauma, animals will become
passive. However, when the situation changes and escape is possible,
the previously traumatized animals will still remain passive, refusing
any attempts at escape [45]. This type of mindset is also often referred
to as an “external locus of control,” and studies have shown that such
a mindset is associated with worse outcomes in life, including lower
net worth and self-destructive financial behaviors [46]. Similar to the
Financial Flashpoints 53
dogs in the Seligman study, a person with this attitude will not be motivated to take action to make life better because they falsely believe it 
won’t matter what they do. A person operating from a place of learned 
helplessness will accrue high credit card debt, because to them, what’s 
the point of trying to have good credit anyway since they will never 
have enough? They max out their credit cards the moment they get 
them, thus causing more debt, which leads to even more scarcity.
Growing Up Rich
Kristen rarely spent time with her parents. Her parents felt more like grandparents, people who would occasionally visit but have little impact on the daily 
lives of Kristen or her siblings. The children’s caretakers were “hired help,” 
including nannies, tutors, chauffeurs, and chefs. The staff often told the children that if they didn’t behave, they would lose their jobs and the children 
would be sent to an orphanage. They would reprimand, “You’re so lucky to 
have money. Stop complaining and look at what you have!” Kristen heard these 
phrases often as she grew up. She and her siblings were surrounded by eight 
hired employees in a huge house, yet they experienced an overwhelming sense 
of loneliness. Kristen felt a huge hole in her life and developed an inability to 
connect with others. She was embarrassed by her wealth and actually tried to 
hide the fact that she was dropped off at school by a chauffeur. This ongoing 
flashpoint taught Kristen to associate money with shame, guilt, disconnection, 
and alienation from others.
In her adult life, Kristen’s beliefs about money caused several negative 
behaviors. She served on over two dozen nonprofit boards, which required 
her to travel constantly. Although she overworked herself, there was a nagging feeling that nothing she ever did was of value. She began to drink excessively and eventually, her marriage ended and her children stopped having 
any contact with her. It was hard for Kristen to trust people because she 
couldn’t tell if they were genuinely interested in being her friend or just liked 
her for her money. At the same time, she never felt like she belonged anywhere, which perpetuated her feelings of loneliness.
People, whether growing-up rich or poor, tend to get stuck in the socioeconomic class in which they were raised. Growing up either poor or rich 
can become tied to a person’s sense of self-identity, which can cause them to 
cling to it. Even if circumstances change, people will continue living as if 
they are still in the old socioeconomic status. It’s not uncommon for people 
who grow up in poverty to manifest a life of scarcity even after they become 
54 Chapter 4 Exploring a Client’s Financial Background
wealthy. For Kristen, she still tried to live and spend like a rich person as an 
adult, even after she lost her wealth.
Financial Rescue
One Saturday morning when Molly was 12 years old, she was told to choose six of 
her favorite toys and pack them in a car because her parents told her they needed 
to move. They had received news that the sheriff was coming later that morning 
and they were not going to be able to live in their house any longer. As she was carrying her treasures to the car, she saw her grandparents pull into the driveway. 
They gave her a hug and asked her to come inside with them. As she neared the 
house, she saw her mom and dad waiting at the front door. As she recalls it, her 
grandmother said: “Good news!” and handed her dad an envelope. He opened it, 
looked up, and began crying. Inside was a check that would cover not only the cost 
of their missed mortgage payments but the price of the entire house. Her grandparents had secretly sold a piece of property and gifted her mom and dad with the 
proceeds. Her mom began screaming and jumping up and down with joy.
Molly thought it was a miracle, and her parents supported that idea by saying “God is good” and “God always provides.” Fast-forward 50 years and Molly 
is self-employed. She lives on the verge of defaulting on her house payment, her 
car payment, and credit card balances. When asked how she plans to tackle these 
financial problems, she responds: “I’m not worried, because the Universe 
will provide.”
When a person gets into financial trouble, it is helpful to reach out to 
friends and family for a one-time loan or financial support. However, this 
behavior can become problematic if the financial trouble keeps repeating and 
this person becomes dependent on being rescued financially or merely expects 
things to “work out” on their own without a plan or taking action. Being bailed 
out frequently can lead to a mindset of apathy. People who repeatedly get bailed 
out by friends and relatives may start to think they don’t need to worry about 
taking responsibility for their own financial lives because they always get rescued. This belief leads to financial dependence, which is not good for the person on either side of that situation. In Chapter 6 we explore, in depth, the 
dynamics between the financial enabler and the financial dependent.
Death or Divorce
At 50 years old, Bruce realized he had been sabotaging himself when it came to 
money but didn’t understand the reason behind it. As soon as he would start to 
Financial Flashpoints 55
become successful in a business venture, he would psychologically crumble and 
destroy the opportunity. When he was invited to dig deeper into his past, he 
remembered an experience he had when he was around 11 years old. A sports car 
drove up and a well-dressed man (the country doctor) got out of the car. The doctor confronted Bruce’s dad, asking him to pay his hospital bill. To Bruce’s surprise, his dad slammed the doctor against his car and told him if he ever came to 
ask for money again, he would kill him. After the doctor drove away, Bruce’s dad 
told him that all the doctor cared about was money and not the life he destroyed.
The hospital bill that the doctor was referring to was from when 
Bruce’s mom was rushed to the hospital with complications from pregnancy. She lost the baby, and Bruce’s dad blamed the doctor. He believed 
the baby died because the doctor wasn’t there to treat his wife. The doctor 
was reportedly playing golf at the time of the incident, or so the story went. 
Clearly, that experience had a huge impact on Bruce. From that moment 
forward, Bruce had a negative association with money. Subconsciously, he 
didn’t want to make his father violently angry or cause the death of someone else by caring too much about money. This manifested in his life in a 
self-destructive way, in the form of sabotaging his business ventures.
Otherwise Unremarkable Happenstance
Not all financial flashpoints are the result of trauma. Sometimes we pick up 
messages from random places in our childhoods, like board games. Can a 
board game change somebody’s life? In this case, it did. A successful entrepreneur shared that his entire family went to university. Everybody except 
him. When asked why he decided not to go to college, he recalled playing the 
Game of Life as a kid. He learned that he could make money faster by skipping college and going straight into the workforce. This left an imprint on 
him, and his entire adult life, he subconsciously based his financial future on 
a board game he played as a child.
Ancestral Flashpoints
A client’s relationship with money can be influenced not only by their own life 
experiences, but also from the experiences of their grandparents, greatgrandparents, and beyond. The experiences of our ancestors become genetically encoded in us even if we don’t know the full story. For instance, a person 
seeing a slithering snake will probably jump away from it. They would do this 
56 Chapter 4 Exploring a Client’s Financial Background
even if they had never been bitten by a snake or warned about them by their 
parents. At some point in humanity’s ancient past, our ancestors learned that 
avoiding snake bites was beneficial to survival and passed down this instinct 
to future generations. In modern times, a person doesn’t need to know the history of snake bites and how they harmed earlier generations; the brain’s fightor-flight response automatically kicks in, protecting a person from potential 
snake bites [11]. As we’ve discussed, our genetic coding that was necessary for 
survival in previous generations is meant to protect us in the present, which is 
why our instinctual responses to perceived threats can be passed down through 
generations without the direct experience of the offspring and grandchildren.
Our experiences in childhood leave us vulnerable to developing beliefs 
that are not 100% accurate, of which we are often not consciously aware, and 
that can have a profound influence over our lives. Our childlike brains lack 
perspective, nuance, and context, and in our attempts to make sense of what’s 
happening, we can easily draw inaccurate conclusions. Since money is a 
taboo topic, we are rarely provided with the opportunity to discuss and 
explore these beliefs, and as such, many go unchallenged well into our adulthood, often having a profound impact on our financial behaviors and 
outcomes.
Financial flashpoints are the underlying cause of many self-destructive 
money behaviors. Studies show that disordered money behaviors are often a 
result of a history of trauma, related to money or otherwise. For example, 
studies have found a link between childhood trauma and gambling disorder [47]. Compulsive hoarding has also been linked to a history of traumatic 
events experienced in childhood [48]. Trauma has been closely linked to a 
host of chronic self-defeating, self-destructive behaviors.
Gender
Many women grew up learning that they shouldn’t think about, deal with, 
or even earn too much money. They were taught that men should be the 
primary breadwinners, and that a woman doesn’t “have a head” for math or 
business. In fact, research has found that the more a wife outearns her husband, the greater the chance of infidelity, marital instability, and lower levels of marital satisfaction [49]. Girls are socialized from a young age to be 
much more comfortable with the idea of being financially dependent on 
their partners [50]. This ongoing financial flashpoint leads to money scripts 
such as, “I need a man to take care of me financially.” Women who were 
raised with this mindset may grow up without even the most basic financial 
knowledge and skills, such as balancing a budget or reading bank statements.
Financial Flashpoints 57
In addition to the conditioning girls receive from a young age about money, 
they are also strapped with more responsibilities at home as adults. Women 
are often pushed to sacrifice their own careers for their families while men 
enjoy the full potential of their occupations [51]. This comes with dire financial consequences for women, leaving them with as much as $1,055,000 less 
cumulative wealth in retirement than their male counterparts [52]. The fact 
that women make less money than men has continued to set women back 
financially. Considering that women tend to live longer than men, later in life 
they are more likely to need long-term care and more retirement savings than 
men. Yet, many women feel uncertain when it comes to investing and are 
climbing an uphill battle of making less money, unequal family care responsibilities, as well as having to take more time off from work to care for family. 
This can lead to career disruptions including missed promotions and having to 
take lower paying jobs which can impact their retirement and social security. 
Men are also shouldered with expectations around work and money that 
can be limiting and even harmful. Many are taught that if their spouse earns 
more money than they do, they are failures. This belief can lead to discontent 
and even infidelity. The harmful and constricting belief that a man’s only 
value is what he earns can play out in unhealthy ways in adulthood. In a 
culture steeped in the worship of wealth and success, men are often under 
enormous pressure to not only provide for their families, but to shoulder the 
financial burdens of the whole family. Rigid gender roles around money in 
our society harms everyone.
The financial flashpoints just discussed lead to money beliefs, or internal 
scripts that play on repeat in a person’s mind due to their adverse, and not so 
adverse, money experiences early in life. It can help financial planners to 
understand these money scripts so they can understand how to counter them 
and lead a client to better decisions about their money.
Stress and Trauma
In their “Stress in America™” survey, the American Psychological Association has consistently found that money ranks as one of the top sources of 
stress in the lives of Americans. Add into the mix experiences steeped in 
intense emotion or even trauma, and it can become difficult to help a client 
overcome limiting or self-destructive money beliefs. It is important to note 
that during the traumatic event, a certain money belief may have been 
100% accurate. But as time goes on and circumstances change, that belief, once 
adapted by the client to survive, may no longer be true or relevant. Take, for 
58 Chapter 4 Exploring a Client’s Financial Background
instance, the Great Depression. During that dark time in history, many 
people lost everything. They trusted banks with their money, and the banks 
lost their hard-earned life savings. For many people, the belief that arose 
out of that traumatic event was, “You can’t trust banks with your money.” 
In the time of the Great Depression, that was 100% true and accurate. But 
as time went on, regulations were put in place to prevent such a catastrophic event from happening in the future. This did very little to restore a 
generation’s faith in the banking system, so many people report finding 
hidden money all over their deceased grandparents’ property: coffee cans 
buried in the yard, rolled-up bills in the freezer, money under the mattress, 
and so on.
Intense emotion can make money beliefs rigid and difficult to change – a 
mindset of “I’m never going to let that happen to me again,” no matter what. 
This is why some people who grew up in poverty never feel like they have 
enough to feel safe and secure. It might be why older generations are less 
willing to take risks, whereas younger generations, who have not had direct 
experiences of devastating market corrections or loss, tend to be more willing to take risks. Ideally, a client will be flexible and open to change. But if 
they are having trouble overcoming these limiting beliefs about money, 
it might be time for them to consider seeing a psychological professional 
for help.
Cultural Events
Events that occur on a national or global scale also have an impact on the 
individual, like that of a tribe. Those who live through economic recessions, 
depressions, or other types of shared economic hardship are likely to pass 
along to younger generations fear or anxiety about not having enough money, 
and the values of saving. The tech bubble is another example of a largescale phenomenon that has had significant cultural impact. With the 
emergence of online trading tools available to everyone, many inexperienced 
investors became “traders,” and when the markets tanked, many sustained 
significant losses. More than one such investor swore off investing as being 
too risky and proceeded to miss out on the biggest bull market in history.
Financial trauma can occur when global events impact an individual economically over an extended period. The psychological effects of the Great 
Depression or hardships related to the Great Recession do not just disappear 
when the period of hardship subsides. Such events can create behaviors and 
habits that can live with the individual, or in some cases a generation, for the 
rest of their lives. As we have described, many of our clients’ grandparents 
were known to save or even hoard due to the Great Depression. Those who lost 
Financial Flashpoints 59
money during the dot-com bubble may have developed a fear of the markets or 
an aversion to investing. Generation X and Y can be perceived as far more pragmatic when it comes to saving, spending, and even how they earn their living 
due to their experiences related to the Great Recession of 2008–2011.
Research has shown how such worldwide economic events have 
impacted individuals and the collective psychology and financial behaviors. The effects of financial crises are often first experienced through 
threats to emotional well-being. For example, foreclosures during the Great 
Recession in 2007  were found to be associated with increased rates of 
depression not just in the individuals who were losing their homes but in 
the community overall, including higher rates of community depression 
and hospital visits [53]. The psychological impact of the Great Recession 
was even worse for those who were more vulnerable prior to the crisis, 
including people who were older and/or poorer precrisis [54].
The effects of cultural financial events can also lead to mass traumatization. For example, a study of 1,208 residents of Athens, Greece found that 
88% were reporting moderate to severe symptoms of posttraumatic stress in 
the wake of the Great Recession, with the elderly, women, and those caring 
for dependents being the hardest hit [55]. Perhaps even more troubling for 
our purposes, a survey of financial planners in 2009 found that in the months 
after the Great Recession, 93% reported medium to high levels of posttraumatic stress – including intrusive thoughts, sleep difficulties, waves of strong 
feelings, and feelings of emotional numbness [56]. The researchers highlighted that this experience corresponded with a mass movement from a buyand-hold approach in favor of tactical asset management, as planners were 
left to question their approach to money management.
In more recent history, the COVID-19 pandemic set an entire planet 
back financially and socially, with long-term implications on the financial, 
social, and educational outcomes of students around the world. The longterm effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will not be fully realized for years to 
come. But what we know thus far is that in 2020, the labor market suffered 
significant setbacks, highlighting income disparities across the globe. In the 
wake of the COVID-19 pandemic there was a combination of financial 
trauma and financial reform that may affect economics for generations. 
As a society as we gain a better sense of the personal and financial cost of 
COVID-19, planners will have to be sensitive to how their clients interpret 
and react to this ever-changing world. Such financial flashpoints and 
traumatic events impact the financial beliefs and biases within individuals, 
families, and communities. When working with a client, it is critical that 
planners consider a client’s cultural financial experiences as well as their 
family and personal financial experiences.
60 Chapter 4 Exploring a Client’s Financial Background
Financial flashpoints, whether experienced directly, witnessed, or 
endured by our ancestors, have a profound impact on the genesis of our relationship with money. In our attempt to survive and thrive, we develop our 
money beliefs. They do not occur and freeze within a given period of time, 
but, rather, stay with us. These beliefs, in turn, drive our financial behaviors 
and lead to predictable financial outcomes. In the next chapter, we continue 
our focus on understanding a client’s financial psychology by exploring the 
research on money beliefs, common patterns seen in clients, and their impact 
on financial behaviors and outcomes.
KEY POINTS
• Financial flashpoints are life events associated with money that have
a lasting impact on our financial beliefs and behaviors.
• Some financial flashpoints are experienced directly, and others have
been experienced by our ancestors, but all have a profound impact on
our relationship with money.
• Financial flashpoints include experiences such as growing up rich,
growing up poor, stress and trauma, gender, cultural or economic
events, and death and divorce.

Chapter 5
Money Beliefs


We all have beliefs about money. Have you ever wondered how two people 
could live within the same community, generation, socioeconomic group, 
and even family, and have dramatically different beliefs about money? Each 
of us spends, saves, and invests differently. Two members of the same family 
with the same income and upbringing could be different clients with different goals, needs, and behaviors. Many of these differences relate to factors 
such as culture and environment. Although we all have similar challenges 
related to our outdated brains, we each have a variety of life experiences that 
stay with us and impact our daily financial lives.
A young girl sat at the dinner table with her parents one evening. She had 
heard her friends talking about how much money their parents made and was 
curious about her own parents. So, she innocently asked her dad how much 
money he made. Without hesitation, her mother slapped her. Through teeth 
gritted in anger, the mother said, “We do not ask people how much money they 
make.” The girl was stunned and confused. Later, in her adult life, she understandably felt a great deal of anxiety whenever she talked about money. She 
avoided the topic of money whenever she could, which led to her being moneyavoidant. Because of her negative associations with money and wealth, she 
sabotaged her financial success. She ignored her bank statements, ran up debt 
from overspending, financially enabled others, and had trouble sticking 
to a budget.
Consider the power of these flashpoints. Although there could have been 
multiple similar incidents as the one just described, the one incident with 
her mother was so profoundly vivid that it had an impact on her financial life

forever! Although not all of our flashpoints are as clear (or violent) as this 
one, we all have them. They could be as mundane as how our parents 
described their spending on a vacation or how we discussed money while 
playing Monopoly. Regardless, they all exist within each of us, as well as in 
our clients. These financial flashpoints lead to money scripts, or internal conversations that play on repeat in a person’s mind due to their adverse, and not 
so adverse, money experiences early in life (as illustrated in Figure 5.1). It 
can help financial planners to understand these money scripts so they can 
understand how to counter them and lead a client to better decisions about 
their money

MONEY SCRIPTS
Financial flashpoints, which often occur in childhood, create underlying 
assumptions and internal conversations about money that are only partially 
true, incomplete, conflicting, and are subconsciously followed in adulthood 
[57, pp. 23–24]. These money scripts are often passed down from generation 
to generation, directly or indirectly, within families and cultures. Money 
scripts can lead to positive financial behaviors as well as self-destructive 
ones. Many clients aren’t consciously aware of their money scripts. Since

Money Scripts 63
money is a taboo topic in our culture, we rarely have the opportunity to 
become aware of, let alone confront, self-limiting beliefs about money. When 
a client feels stuck in painful or self-destructive patterns around money, 
there is likely some unresolved emotional pain or trauma hidden in their 
past. When this unresolved pain is left unexamined, it can cause a client to 
live reactively, rather than actively. An effective financial planner is familiar 
with common money scripts. This allows them to help a client navigate 
through their subconscious beliefs and make healthy financial decisions.
While the field of psychology has known about the impact of beliefs on 
emotions and behaviors for decades, only recently has research investigated 
the impact of beliefs about money on an individual’s financial life. To help 
identify these beliefs, the Klontz Money Script Inventory (KMSI) was developed in 2011 and is used by many financial professionals to measure their 
clients’ money beliefs and attitudes [58, pp.  77–81]. The KMSI (and the 
newer, more streamlined KSMI-R) is a comprehensive, valid, efficient, and 
reliable test that can serve as a guide for clients to help them identify money 
scripts that are helping and/or causing harm to their financial well-being. In 
the revised version of the test, there are 32 money statements that fall into 
four categories: (1) money avoidance, (2) money worship (often referred to as 
money focus when used in a financial planning context), (3) money status, 
and (4) money vigilance.
Money Avoidance
At the heart of money avoidance is the belief that money is dirty, evil, stressful, and/or makes people greedy. In fact, the money-avoidant may believe 
that there is virtue in having less money. Most people are familiar with the 
belief that money is evil, whether it was instilled in them from a religious 
background, their parents, or their communities. Money-avoidant money 
scripts associated with the idea that money is bad include beliefs such as:
• “Rich people are greedy.”
• “Good people should not care about money.”
• “It is not okay to have more than you need.”
• “It is hard to be rich and be a good person.”
• “Most rich people do not deserve their money.”
• “Money corrupts people.”
• “There is virtue in living with less money.”
64 Chapter 5 Money Beliefs
When examining this belief, it’s easy to see why someone would sabotage their own financial progress [58, pp. 77–81]. If a client believes that having too much money will make them evil or miserable, it makes sense that 
they would struggle to earn and save.
Money avoidance is often linked to those in helping professions and 
strong religious backgrounds. In this mindset, people believe that as long as 
they do what’s right with the best intentions, they will be rewarded with 
“good karma” or abundant blessings from God or the universe. This belief 
can lead people into a life of righteous poverty and scarcity. It is necessary to 
do good for others while simultaneously helping oneself. Those who work in 
social services or religious servitude often adopt this mindset. The belief that 
being of service, happiness, love, and belonging are more important than 
money can be a positive one, as long as it doesn’t go too far. When a person is 
so devoted to others that they forget their own needs, this mindset becomes 
problematic. It can also be a cover for money avoidance or lack of financial 
responsibility.
Those who avoid money may also think they don’t deserve money, illustrated by the money script: “I do not deserve a lot of money when others have 
less than me.” This could be associated with imposter syndrome, or the idea 
that the client has no right to enjoy their money when others are suffering. 
This money belief is commonly associated with low self-esteem. Even if 
someone manages to accumulate wealth while operating within this mindset, they will be impoverished emotionally and spiritually.
Studies show that those with money-avoidant beliefs tend to have lower 
levels of education, as well as lower income and net worth. Money avoidance 
can lead to many self-defeating money behaviors, such as hoarding disorder, 
financial enabling, compulsive buying disorder, workaholism, and financial 
denial [3]. Young, single adults tend to be money-avoidant. Occupation is 
also associated with money avoidance, especially among mental health 
professions [59].
Money Focus
Clients who have money-worshipping tendencies may have beliefs such as:
• “More money will make you happier.”
• “There will never be enough money.”
• “You can never have enough money.”
Money Scripts 65
• “Money would solve all of my problems.”
• “Money is power.”
• “Money buys freedom.”
It’s common for people to believe that money brings happiness, peace, 
security, or whatever it is they’re seeking. But usually this “more money” 
vision is based on an arbitrary, magical number that has very little to do with 
happiness. Once our essential needs are met, happiness is much less related 
to the amount of money we have in the bank than many of us think. Instead 
of lamenting about what they don’t have, clients may benefit from shifting 
their focus toward making what they do have work for them.
Those who grew up economically disadvantaged may look at the life of a 
wealthy person and wish they could be rich too. They may see money as a 
magic wand that demands respect, opens doors of opportunity, and makes 
life more meaningful. In this frame of mind, a person may equate money 
with success. Just like with other money beliefs, there is partial truth to this 
one. However, it doesn’t consider the whole picture, such as respect being 
earned by those who work hard, make meaningful achievements, and treat 
others with respect.
Studies show that the clients who are most vulnerable to these beliefs are 
typically younger, single, and have lower levels of education, income, and 
net worth, while having higher levels of revolving credit debt. Those with 
money-worship beliefs are predicted to be more susceptible to compulsive 
buying disorder, hoarding disorder, workaholism, financial dependence, 
financial enabling, and financial denial [56].
Money Status
Those who operate under money status beliefs will equate their self-worth 
with their net worth. Money status includes beliefs such as:
• “Your self-worth equals your net worth.”
• “If something is not considered ‘the best’ it is not worth buying.”
• “People are only as successful as the amount of money they earn.”
• “I will not buy something unless it is new (e.g. car, house).”
• “If someone asked me how much I earned, I would probably tell them 
I earn more than I actually do.”
66 Chapter 5 Money Beliefs
It is a sign of good financial health to believe that we have a right to enjoy 
and spend our money on ourselves and our loved ones. However, this belief 
wanders into dangerous territory when it serves as a catalyst for spending 
beyond one’s means. Creating and sticking to budgets and committing to savings can curb this entitlement around overindulgence.
Like the two previous categories, money status beliefs are associated 
with younger, single people with lower education, income, and net worth. 
Those with a money status mindset have a greater likelihood of having grown 
up in a lower socioeconomic class. Money status beliefs are a predictor of 
compulsive buying disorder, gambling disorder, financial dependence, and 
financial infidelity (56). Those in the top tiers of wealth are also impacted by 
these beliefs, indicating that the money status mindset can be a motivator to 
reach high levels of wealth, since self-worth is equated with net worth [93].
Money Vigilance
Some degree of money vigilance is a good thing. It keeps people from building up high revolving credit debt and can be the catalyst for saving money. 
However, it can also be the source of shame and secrecy around money. 
Money vigilance includes beliefs such as:
• “Money should be saved and not spent.”
• “It is important to save for a rainy day.”
• “You should not tell others how much money you have or make.”
• “It is wrong to ask others how much money they have or make.”
• “If you cannot pay cash for something, you should not buy it.”
• “I would be a nervous wreck if I did not have money saved for an 
emergency.”
• “It is extravagant to spend money on oneself.”
• “I would be embarrassed to tell someone how much money I make.”
• “It is not polite to talk about money.”
Money vigilance is great for your financial health but at its extreme it can 
cause undue stress and anxiety. There may be a fear of not having enough, 
even when there is financial solvency. 
From the money vigilance category, the belief that there will never be 
enough money can do a great deal of harm to one’s financial life. Ebenezer 
Scrooge lived according to this belief and found himself in a life of deprivation and loneliness. This mindset can cause constant fear and anxiety around 
The Role of the Financial Planner 67
money. It leads people to become workaholics who sacrifice everything else 
to protect themselves from scarcity, even beyond necessity. Others adopt a 
“what’s the point” attitude. They blow through any extra money or revolving 
credit as fast as possible before it vanishes, which in turn causes more scarcity.
THE ROLE OF THE FINANCIAL PLANNER
Awareness is an important first step in the process of dismantling harmful or 
negative beliefs around money. Often, when a person becomes aware of erroneous or misguided money beliefs, they can make modifications to those 
beliefs and change their behaviors. However, if there are intense emotions 
attached to those beliefs, money scripts can be difficult to change. Even 
though the client knows the beliefs are unbalanced, they may not be able to 
change their behaviors. In some circumstances such individuals may need 
the assistance of a financial therapist to help unlock their money beliefs. 
Financial planners can help clients become aware of their money scripts 
through discussions or using instruments such as the KMSI or KMSI-R. 
Financial planners who use the KMSI-R in practice have outlined the following four-step framework for administering and reviewing the test as well as 
delivering and reviewing the results with clients [60].
Step 1: Administer. Financial planners can administer the test in the discovery phase of the financial planning process, after trust and rapport have been established, often taking place in the second or third 
client meeting. They note that it is important for the planner to not 
just hand the test to the client or send a link without an explanation 
of why and how the information will be used in the financial planning process. The following is a version of what they suggest: “Our 
beliefs about money influence our financial decisions, whether we 
are aware of the connection or not. This assessment is designed to 
help us learn more about your money scripts. As will all information you share with us, your answers will be confidential. The most 
useful responses are the ones that come to mind immediately, without censoring yourself. So make sure to respond honestly, and we 
can talk over the results during a future session.”
Step 2: Analyze. In this step the planner scores the assessment or reviews 
the automated scoring. Rather than distinct “personalities,” it is 
common to see elevations in more than one scale. For example, 
studies have found a strong association between high scores on 
68 Chapter 5 Money Beliefs
money avoidance and high scores on money focus [56]. In other 
words, the people who have the strongest negative associations 
with money are also the ones who most desperately want to have 
more money themselves. The analysis of the client should be done 
objectively, meaning it is important not to attach labels to the client 
based on the results. We are using this as a tool to help us help our 
clients. After this analysis of categories, the advisor can dive deeper 
into the assessment to review extreme scores on individual items.
Step 3: Clarify. Assessments are not meant to diagnose or come to a conclusion about the client’s financial psychology. Instead they are 
meant to be starting points for conversation. In this step, financial 
planners can explore the deeper meanings, and stories behind their 
clients’ responses, using open-ended questions. For example, a 
planner may comment: “I see you responded to item 5 as ‘strongly 
disagree.’ Tell me more about what that means to you.”
Step 4: Incorporate. The final step is utilizing this newfound information 
in your work with the client. For example, for a client who scores 
high on money vigilance and has little experience with investing, 
you might predict that in times of market downturns they may 
appreciate you proactively reaching out to them to get in front of 
their anxiety about losing hard earned money.
Flashpoints at different points in our lives create conscious and subconscious beliefs about money that have a profound impact on our decisions 
and behaviors, whether as individuals or as clients. Money scripts emerge 
out of our attempts to make sense of these financial flashpoints. An important step in understanding why people do what they do around money is to 
recognize, and ultimately evaluate, underlying beliefs and where they came 
from. In the next chapter, we explore how financial behaviors can have a 
negative impact on a person’s financial outcomes, with a focus on behaviors 
that are commonly seen in the financial planner’s office. We also explore the 
role of the financial planner when these behaviors are observed. In some 
cases, the financial planner is uniquely positioned to address them, and in 
others the planner should look for an appropriate referral. In the accompanying toolkit, you can take the KMSI-R as well as learn more about ways to 
help clients of different money scripts profiles.

Financial Behaviors and Outcomes

Thus far, we have focused on all of the factors that impact what we do as 
related to money. Whether it be evolutionary traits, cultural and environmental factors, or financial flashpoints born out of our own experiences or 
those of our ancestors, we arrive at a set of beliefs around money that drive 
our financial behaviors. Unfortunately, in many cases, our responses and 
behaviors are inconsistent with our own personal goals. There are numerous 
financial behaviors that can have a significant impact on our clients’ financial well-being (see Figure 6.1). In Part III, we introduce strategies and tools 
that the financial planner can adopt to address many of these financial 
behaviors, all in helping the client meet their financial and life goals.
Many of our clients have great financial behaviors. For starters, many 
have acquired sufficient assets that necessitate the assistance of investment 
advice from a financial planner. Typically, this requires the ability to delay 
gratification, prioritize future goals over near-term rewards, save, invest, and 
resist impulses to act irrationally, such as taking excessive risks or falling for 
get-rich-quick schemes. However, good financial health is not necessarily 
the norm, and the average American is in terrible financial shape. Financial 
planners often encounter problematic financial behaviors with clients from 
all different economic backgrounds. Even if most of their clientele have good 
financial health, it is not uncommon for clients to have spouses, children, 
family, or friends who exhibit problematic behaviors, many of which can 
have a direct or indirect impact on them.

FIGURE 6.1  Klontz- Chaffin Model of Financial Psychology
OVERSPENDING AND UNDERSAVING
In American culture, it is easy to fall into the trap of overspending. Celebrities 
on social media flaunt their wealth and pop stars sing about their fancy cars 
and jewelry. There is a strong pull on Americans to spend more than they have, 
in many cases spending impulsively. But aside from the allure of social media 
and pop culture, overspending can also result from money disorders such as 
compulsive buying, gambling, workaholism, and financial enabling. Regardless of the reason, overspending is a serious issue for many people. Consumer 
debt has become a chronic problem for Americans. As of 2021, Americans 
owed $807 billion, with the average family owing approximately $6,000 [61]. 
According to a survey in debt.org, roughly 40% of Americans reported that 
their credit card debt had a negative effect on their happiness, and one in five 
people said the stress from credit card debt was harming their health [61].
FINANCIAL DENIAL
People with financial denial try to avoid thinking about money, try to forget 
about their financial situation, and avoid looking at their bank account. 
Financial denial is usually in response to some difficult financial situation 
and since those tend to develop gradually over time, financial denial tends to 
Financial Infidelity 73
build as well. Studies have found that financial denial is associated with 
being younger, less educated, single, and having lower income, lower net 
worth, higher revolving credit card debt, and self-destructive financial behaviors, including compulsive buying, pathological gambling, compulsive 
hoarding, workaholism, financial dependence, and financial enabling [62].
FINANCIAL PARALYSIS
There is a paradox of choice, where we value the power and autonomy that 
come from more options but we can become incapacitated when we try to 
evaluate all of them. Choosing between options, particularly if they all seem 
similar, can be cognitively taxing. When a definitive choice is not readily apparent among many, our tendency is to become overwhelmed and take no action. 
In one of the famous studies related to choice, two different stands contained 
different types of jam for sale at a grocery store [63]. One of the stands had 24 
options and the other had only 6. The stand that had only 6 jams to choose 
from made far more sales than the one with 24. More options may seem like 
more freedom but it is actually the opposite and can create financial paralysis 
in clients if they do not have help from their advisor in walking through limited options. But financial planners can utilize choice architecture, a strategy 
in which an overwhelming or sometimes confusing number of choices is limited to a small number. In many cases, the financial planner can share the top 
three choices (being transparent that there are more options) and discuss how 
clients with similar goals or backgrounds tend to opt for one of them.
FINANCIAL INFIDELITY
Money stress can be hard on marriages. Research shows that money is the 
main source of marital disagreement in the early years of marriage and fights 
over money are the leading cause of marital dissatisfaction [64]. According to 
a survey by CNBC, one in five couples admitted that money is their biggest 
challenge [65]. While some disagreements about money may occur between 
spouses from time to time, this behavior can become dysfunctional in some 
cases. When couples constantly fight over money, keep secrets or lie about 
money, or one uses it to control and wield power over the other, they are in the 
territory of financial infidelity. Financial infidelity can not only destroy marriages, but it can also affect future relationships. Situations in which someone 
lies, keeps secrets, or tries to control their spouse with money inevitably lead 
Klontz983729_c06.indd 73 8/1/2022 12:16:05 PM
74 Chapter 6 Financial Behaviors and Outcomes
to an unhappy marriage and, likely, divorce. After moving on from the dysfunctional relationship, a person may have trouble trusting a new partner 
when it comes to money, which can lead to money-avoidant behaviors.
FINANCIAL ENMESHMENT
Financial enmeshment occurs when parents share too much information 
about their finances with their children, or involve them inappropriately in 
financial matters [66]. Examples of financial enmeshment include:
• A parent relying on a child for emotional support when dealing with 
financial stress.
• Using children to pass on messages about money between divorced or 
separated parents.
• Using their child’s social security number to open accounts in the parent’s name.
• A parent borrowing a child’s savings or earnings from babysitting or 
other teen-appropriate jobs.
• Disparaging a child’s other parent in front of them (e.g., “I can’t buy 
you a birthday present because your mom makes me pay so much in 
child support.”).
Financial enmeshment can not only cause a negative relationship with 
money as the child grows into adulthood, but it can also cause severe psychological pain. While it is important for a parent to teach their children about 
money, it is inappropriate for a parent to involve children in adult financial 
matters. Although a parent may feel tempted to lean on their children for 
emotional venting or support, it is better for them to rely on a trusted adult 
who has the maturity and emotional capacity to deal with that kind of burden. If a parent is actively taking financial advantage of a child, it may be time 
for a mental health professional or social worker to step in and offer assistance.
FINANCIAL ENABLING
As parents, it can be difficult to say no to children when they ask for money, 
even when they are adults and can provide for themselves. Financial enabling is a problematic money behavior that can complicate the parent/child 
Klontz983729_c06.indd 74 8/1/2022 12:16:05 PM
Financial Enabling 75
relationship. Of course, there may be times when parents need to help their 
child through difficult financial situations or emergencies, such as unexpected job loss, medical bills, or a down payment on a home or vehicle. But 
it ventures into the territory of financial enabling when the adult child is 
capable of handling their own finances but has become accustomed to their 
parents bailing them out.
Parental enabling is one of the most common issues financial planners 
notice among their clients [58, pp. 127–130]. It’s an age-old dilemma. Parents 
don’t want to see their children suffer, but too much help can actually prevent them from learning how to become independent and resolve their own 
problems. It may seem that financially helping an adult child would benefit 
the child and satisfy a parent’s sense of care and responsibility, but constant 
enabling comes with unintended consequences. It can create a sense of entitlement and dependence in the child, while brewing anger and resentment 
in the parents. Young adults who have everything handed to them are at risk 
of losing their creativity, drive, self-respect, and innovation [58, pp. 127–130]. 
Parents who constantly give their adult children money may lose their retirement savings, which could potentially make them dependent on their adult 
children in the future.
A good question for parents to ask before giving their adult children 
money is: “Will this financial support help solve a problem and make the 
recipient more stable and stronger . . . or . . . will this create an unhealthy 
dependency, further weakening them and destroying their own ability to 
help themselves?”
This question can help the giver to discern the difference between necessary financial support and destructive financial enabling.
For those on the giving end of financial enabling, it can be just as destructive as it is for those on the receiving end. Studies show that financial enablers tend to have higher debt in revolving credit accounts and lower net 
worth. Studies have also found that financial enabling often takes place in 
individuals who grew up in lower-income households [3]. Many also engage 
in financial denial and money avoidance, and exhibit financial enmeshment 
behaviors, often following money worship scripts while being less vigilant 
with their own finances [3]. Some strategies for clients who are stuck in 
financial enabling behaviors are as follows [3]:
• Recognize that financial enabling can do more harm than good.
Financial planners have an important role in helping their 
clients realize the ways the financial enabling can exacerbate financial problems, rather than making them better.

76 Chapter 6 Financial Behaviors and Outcomes
• Lift the curse of too many options.
When a person has too many options, it can create a dizzying 
loss of a sense of direction and lack of purpose. If financial enabling 
has left the recipient with too many options or too much unstructured free time, their lives may atrophy. All human beings need to 
engage in active, gainful pursuits that motivate them to interact with 
the world, overcome challenges, and achieve goals. These pursuits 
are essential to a meaningful, fulfilling life.
• Make a plan and stick to it.
If a client doesn’t want their dependents to go “cold turkey,” they 
may find it more appealing to make a plan of slowly removing 
financial support over an agreed-upon time period. It can help to 
write out an agreement, which both parties may sign, stating the 
conditions in which financial support will come to an end. This 
could be a three- or six-month plan to give the recipient time to make 
arrangements to be self-sufficient. However, if the enabler does not 
stick to the agreement, it could create the opposite effect. The recipient may not make any serious future attempts to stop the support. 
This could cause a perpetual cycle that is quite hard to escape: The 
enabler bails out the recipient, says it’s the last time, the recipient 
doesn’t believe them because they’ve said that many times before, so 
they continue their problematic money behaviors. Instead, they get 
into financial trouble again, and the enabler once again bails out the 
recipient, saying this is the last time. To avoid this cycle, here are 
some steps a client may take to stick to their agreement to stop the 
financial support:
1. Set dates for when the financial contributions will be reduced 
or stopped.
2. Learn other ways to provide support, such as contributing to a 
trade school or career counseling, paying for therapy or coaching, 
or donating financial planning sessions.
3. Write and rehearse a script for informing the recipient that the 
financial support is ending. A therapist may be able to help the client with this. Rehearsing the script before telling the dependent is 
crucial so that they don’t get flustered or waver off track.
4. Gather a support system that will help the enabler stick to the agreement. It can be difficult to break family patterns. Support, in the 
form of friends or a support group, can help the giver stay strong 
and remember the reasons they are doing this in the first place.

Financial Dependence 77
5. Enlist the help of other professionals. Sometimes, a financial planner may be able to help a client refrain from financial enabling. 
Other times, a client may need to reach out to a mental health professional and/or a financial therapist. If a client has tried repeatedly to stop their financial enabling behaviors but keeps falling 
back into the same pattern, it’s likely a sign that they need a therapist to help them.
FINANCIAL DEPENDENCE
On the other side of financial enabling, one usually finds financial dependence. Financial dependence occurs when someone finds themselves relying 
on the support of others for nonemployed income. This dependency often 
causes anxiety, anger, or resentment from the fear of being cut off while suppressing their motivation, innovation, passion, creativity, and drive to succeed [3]. Financial dependence and dependent personality disorder share 
similar characteristics. According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic of Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a person might exhibit dependent personality disorder in the following ways [67]:
1. Trouble making decisions on their own without an extreme amount 
of advice and encouragement from others.
2. A strong need for others to assume responsibility for important 
aspects of their lives.
3. Trouble disagreeing with others for fear of losing approval or 
appreciation.
4. Difficulty initiating projects or doing things on their own.
5. Tries too hard to get approval, nurturance, or support from others.
6. Feels scared of being alone because they feel helpless and are worried 
they can’t take care of themselves.
7. An urgent need to seek out new relationships when another relationship ends to satisfy their needs for care and support.
8. Unreasonably fearful and preoccupied with the worry that they will 
be left alone to fend for themselves.
To qualify for a diagnosis of dependent personality disorder, a person 
must exhibit at least five of the above criteria [58, pp. 127–130]. Financial

78 Chapter 6 Financial Behaviors and Outcomes
dependence can present itself in similar ways to dependent personality disorder, and can be just as unhealthy for the dependent as well as for the enabler. Financial dependence can cause increased amounts of parent/child 
conflict. It’s a growing problem, with as much as 60% of parents financially 
supporting their adult children [58, pp. 127–130]. This can cause financial 
hardship for the enabling parent, as well as an unhealthy dependence for the 
adult child.
The parent/child relationship is not the only place where financial 
dependency can be present. Dependency may occur between siblings or 
other relatives and can be passed down through generations. Financial 
dependence may go hand-in-hand with other disorders, such as gambling 
disorder, compulsive buying disorder, or hoarding disorder [58, pp. 127–130]. 
Similar to financial enabling, financial dependence is associated with lower 
income and less education and occurs more often in those who are single  [62]. However, it can also occur in beneficiaries of trust funds from 
wealthy parents. Those struggling with financial dependence are more likely 
to have money worship and money status scripts [58, pp. 127–130]. Financial 
dependence can be created by an imbalance of power in a marriage or partnership. Victims of domestic violence might feel compelled to stay in an abusive relationship because they are financially dependent on their abuser. One 
study showed that 46% of domestic violence victims cited a lack of money as 
the reason for returning to their abusers after escaping [68].
As with financial enabling, a financially dependent person may benefit 
from seeking the help of a therapist. Financial planners may need to refer the 
enabler and the dependent(s) to a mental health professional to explore 
deeper issues around these money behaviors.
MONEY DISORDERS
Sometimes, money behaviors can become so problematic that they meet the 
threshold of psychological disorders. Money disorders can occur in those 
who are poor just as much as in those who are wealthy. Some common elements in these disorders are emotional pain, often a history of trauma, and 
impairment in one or more areas of their lives, including social, relational, 
and/or occupational functioning. A financial planner is not qualified to try to 
address these behaviors in someone who needs this level of psychological 
help. When a client is dealing with a money disorder, they should be referred 
to a mental health professional.

Money Disorders 79
As a financial planner, it is likely that you may never encounter the following set of behaviors in your client, because they are often accompanied by 
denial and a lack of financial planning and/or resources. However, you will 
likely hear clients report some of these behaviors in family members, children, and/or business partners. As such, it is important that financial planners are aware that these conditions exist and to have some basic information 
regarding how they manifest and what they can do within the boundaries of 
their professional competence when they recognize these behaviors.
Gambling Disorder
Gambling can be a fun pastime but like most behaviors, if taken to the 
extreme, can lead to significant problems. In fact, excessive gambling can 
become a full-blown clinical addiction. According to the National Center 
for Responsible Gambling, approximately 1% of the adult population in 
the United States has a severe gambling problem, with recent research 
estimating that 6–9% of young people and young adults experience problems with gambling [69]. The DSM-5 defines gambling disorders as a “persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically 
significant impairment or distress”  [70]. The gambling industry understands the psychology of gambling and uses that information to keep people gambling. For instance, the use of poker chips, tokens, or digital credits 
serves to distance people from the experience of losing actual money. This 
keeps the reality of the loss out of a person’s mind and keeps them at 
the tables.
Slot machines are designed around the most powerful behavioral reinforcement schedule known to psychology, called the “variable ratio schedule 
of reinforcement.” As discussed in Chapter 2 as it relates to gambler’s fallacy, 
the gambler doesn’t know when they will hit or how much they will get, but 
they know if they keep hitting the button they will eventually win something, relying on that old adage, “you have to play to win.” These periodic 
“wins” keep them gambling longer and longer and eventually losing more 
and more. It’s not only casinos that create an environment for people with 
gambling disorders to lose their money. Day trading is another siren song for 
gamblers, luring them into making risky investments. Individuals with gambling disorder will often make promises to themselves and their loved ones to 
stop, but chronically break these intentions and promises. In its extreme, 
gambling disorder can lead to criminal behavior, such as theft and 
embezzlement.

80 Chapter 6 Financial Behaviors and Outcomes
Compulsive Buying Disorder
A person with compulsive buying disorder is similar to a person with gambling disorder, in that they can become addicted to the behavior. Compulsive 
buyers feel compelled to keep buying merchandise and services, even when 
those purchases cause negative financial, personal, or occupational consequences [71]. For someone with compulsive buying disorder, excessive purchases are often used as a way to cope with stress, improve their mood, boost 
their self-esteem, or feel accepted [72]. They often feel shame, guilt, and 
regret after the purchases, making them rush to soothe themselves with even 
more purchases. A financial planner rarely has a client who has a compulsive buying disorder. However, a planner may encounter a married couple in 
which one spouse is a compulsive shopper and the other is asking for help 
trying to manage the problem. As with all money disorders covered in this 
section, a financial planner is not qualified to diagnose or treat the condition. 
Instead, they should look to refer the individual who appears to have difficulty curbing their shopping behaviors to a qualified mental health professional for diagnosis and possible treatment.
Hoarding Disorder
It is not uncommon for those with compulsive buying disorder to also engage 
in hoarding behaviors. In the DSM-5, hoarding disorder is classified under 
obsessive-compulsive and related disorders [73]. Hoarders feel the need to 
save items, even if they have no value, often feeling distressed at the idea of 
parting with them. They accumulate possessions until their belongings fill 
their homes, stacking up to create fire and safety hazards. They usually need 
outside intervention to declutter their living spaces, such as the persistent 
nudge of friends or family members, cleaners, or authorities. In addition to 
items, it is also possible to hoard money [74]. Planners may come up against 
compulsive hoarding in clients who feel a strong fear toward spending their 
money, even if they have a lot of it.
THE ROLE OF THE FINANCIAL PLANNER
In their work with clients and families, financial planners encounter the 
entire spectrum of financial behaviors. While many clients exhibit prudent 
financial behaviors that coincide with wealth creation, others engage in 
Klontz983729_c06.indd 80 8/1/2022 12:16:06 PM
CFP Board Learning Objectives Covered in This Chapter 81
behaviors that at minimum, limit and at worse, threaten their financial wellbeing. The financial planner plays a role in some of these behaviors as a 
trusted advisor, flagging potential issues in discussions with clients and providing guidance and support.
In the following chapters, we review strategies and techniques drawn 
from psychology and counseling and how financial planners can adapt and 
use them within the boundaries of their competence to help facilitate the 
financial health of their clients. It is equally important for financial planners 
to know the warning signs of money disorders so they can refer the client to 
a mental health professional. As discussed earlier, financial planners should 
never try to diagnose or treat clients with money disorders.
KEY POINTS
• Our financial behaviors are a result of our financial beliefs and are a 
product of our environment and past experiences.
• Although not equipped to treat or diagnose, the financial planner can 
highlight problematic financial behaviors to the client and help lead 
them to better financial decisions.
• Financial planners need to be aware of financial behaviors that could 
indicate the need for a referral to a mental health professional.
