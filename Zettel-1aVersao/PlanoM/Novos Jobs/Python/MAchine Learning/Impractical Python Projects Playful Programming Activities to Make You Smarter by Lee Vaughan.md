### Impractical Python Projects Playful Programming Activities to Make You Smarter by Lee Vaughan


Chapter 1: Silly Name Generator This warm­up project introduces the Python PEP
8 and PEP 257 style guides as well as the Pylint and pydocstyle modules, which analyze
your code’s conformance to these guidelines. The end product is a goofy­name
generator inspired by the USA Network TV show Psych.

Chapter 2: Finding Palingram Spells Learn how to profile your code while saving
DC Comics sorceress Zatanna from a painful death. Search online dictionaries for the
magical palingrams that Zatanna needs to beat a time­reversing villain.

Chapter 3: Solving Anagrams Write a program that helps a user create a phrase
anagram from their name; for example, Clint Eastwood yields old west action. Then
help Tom Marvolo Riddle derive his anagram, “I am Lord Voldemort,” using linguistic
sieves.

Chapter 4: Decoding American Civil War Ciphers Investigate and crack one of
the most successful military ciphers in history, the Union route cipher. Then help spies
on both sides send and decode secret messages using the zig­zagging rail fence cipher.

Chapter 5: Encoding English Civil War Ciphers Read a message hidden in plain
sight by decoding a null cipher from the English Civil War. Then save the head of Mary,
Queen of Scots, by designing and implementing code to accomplish the more difficult
task of writing a null cipher.

Chapter 6: Writing in Invisible Ink Help a corporate mole betray Sherlock
Holmes’s dad and evade detection with invisible electronic ink. This chapter is based on
an episode of the CBS television show Elementary.

Chapter 7: Breeding Giant Rats with Genetic Algorithms Use genetic
algorithms—inspired by Darwinian evolution—to breed a race of super­rats the size of
female bullmastiffs. Then help James Bond crack a safe with 10 billion possible
combinations in the blink of an eye.

Chapter 8: Counting Syllables for Haiku Poetry Teach your computer to count
syllables in English as a prelude to writing Japanese poetry, or haiku, in the next
chapter.

Chapter 9: Writing Haiku with Markov Chain Analysis Teach your computer to
write haiku by combining the syllable­counting module from Chapter 8 with Markov
chain analysis and a training corpus of several hundred ancient and modern haiku.

Chapter 10: Are We Alone? Exploring the Fermi Paradox Investigate the
absence of alien radio signals using Drake’s equation, the dimensions of the Milky Way
galaxy, and assumptions about the size of detectable “emissions bubbles.” Learn and
use the popular tkintermodule to build a graphical display of the galaxy and Earth’s
own radio bubble.

Chapter 11: The Monty Hall Problem Help the world’s smartest woman win the
Monty Hall problem argument. Then use object­oriented programming (OOP) to build
a version of Monty’s famous game with a fun graphical interface.

Chapter 12: Securing Your Nest Egg Plan your (or your parents’) secure
retirement using a Monte Carlo–based financial simulation.

Chapter 13: Simulating an Alien Volcano Use pygameto simulate a volcanic
eruption on Io, one of Jupiter's moons.

Chapter 14: Mapping Mars with the Mars Orbiter Build a gravity­based arcade
game and nudge a satellite into a circular mapping orbit without running out of fuel or
burning up in the atmosphere. Display readouts of key parameters, track orbital paths,
add the planet’s shadow, and spin Mars slowly on its axis, all while learning orbital
mechanics!

Chapter 15: Improving Your Astrophotography with Planet Stacking Reveal
Jupiter’s cloud bands and Great Red Spot by optically stacking poor­quality video
images using the Python imaging library. Learn how to work with files, folders, and
directory paths using the built­in osand shutilmodules.

Chapter 16: Finding Frauds with Benford’s Law Use Benford’s law to
investigate vote tampering in the 2016 presidential election. Use matplotlibto
summarize the results in a chart.
