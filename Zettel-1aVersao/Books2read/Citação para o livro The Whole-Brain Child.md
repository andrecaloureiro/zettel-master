### INTRODUCTION ###


- Survive and Thrive

- You want them to enjoy meaningful relationships, be caring and compassionate, do well in school, work hard and be responsible, and feel good about who they are.

- They want to survive difficult parenting moments, and they want their kids and their family to thrive
- Take a moment and ask yourself: What do you really want for your children? What qualities do you hope they develop and take into their adult lives? Most likely you want them to be happy, independent, and successful.

- If you’re like most parents, you worry that you spend too much time just trying to get through the day


- You might even measure yourself against some sort of perfect parent

- We can transform the experience into one that develops not only each child’s brain but also her relationship skills and her character.

- You can use all of the interactions you share—the stressful, angry ones as well as the miraculous, adorable ones—as opportunities to help them become the responsible, caring, capable people you want them to be.

- using those everyday moments with your kids to help them reach their true potential. T

### CHAPTER 1 ###

*****

Parenting with the Brain in Mind

*****

even the most caring, best-educated parents often lack basic information about their child’s brain.

*****

the brain pretty much determines who we are and what we do

*****

knowing about the way the brain changes in response to our parenting can help us to nurture a stronger, more resilient child.

*****

fundamental concepts about the brain and help you apply your new knowledge in ways that will make parenting easier and more meaningful.

*****

by understanding a few simple and easy-to-master basics about how the brain works, you’ll be able to better understand your child, respond more effectively to difficult situations, and build a foundation for social, emotional, and mental health.

*****

straightforward, scientifically based ideas that will help you build a strong relationship with your child that can help shape his brain well and give him the best foundation for a healthy and happy life.

Eea woo woo,” Marco was focusing on the detail of the story that mattered most to him: Sophia had been taken away from him.

*****

many of us would be tempted to assure Marco that Sophia would be fine, then immediately focus on something else to get the child’s mind off the situation: “Let’s go get some ice cream!

*****

leaves the child confused about what happened and why.

*****

Since she knew the importance of helping her son’s brain process the frightening experience, she helped him tell and retell the events so that he could process his fear and go on with his daily routines in a healthy and balanced way.

*****

left side of the brain that helps you think logically and organize thoughts

*****

right side that helps you experience emotions and read nonverbal cues

*****

That’s what integration does: it coordinates and balances the separate regions of the brain that it links together.

*****

Tantrums, meltdowns, aggression, and most of the other challenging experiences of parenting—and life—are a result of a loss of integration, also known as dis-integration.

*****

horizontally integrated, so that their left-brain logic can work well with their right-brain emotion.

*****

vertically integrated, so that the physically higher parts of their brain, which let them thoughtfully consider their actions, work well with the lower parts, which are more concerned with instinct, gut reactions, and survival.

*****

technology that allows researchers to study the brain in ways that were never before possible.

*****

brain is actually “plastic,” or moldable

*****

What molds our brain? Experience. Even into old age, our experiences actually change the physical structure of the brain.

*****

When neurons fire together, they grow new connections between them

*****

we can actually rewire it so that we can be healthier and happier

*****

brain will develop well given proper food, sleep, and stimulation. Genes, of course, play a large role in how people turn out, especially in terms of temperament.

*****

This book will show you how to use everyday experiences to help your child’s brain become more and more integrated.

*****

parents can directly shape the unfolding growth of their child’s brain according to what experiences they offer

*****

This wire-and-rewire process is what integration is all about: giving our children experiences to create connections between different parts of the brain

*****

integrated brain is capable of doing much more than its individual parts could accomplish alone.

*****

by telling the story with Marco, Marianna helped focus his attention both on the actual details of the accident and on his emotions, which allowed him to use both the left and right sides of his brain together, literally strengthening their connection.

*****

another example

*****

these everyday parenting challenges result from a lack ofintegration within your child’s brain

*****

by using everyday moments, you can influence how well your child’s brain grows toward integration

*****

We’re talking about simply being present with your children so you can help them become better integrated

*****

When a person is well integrated, he enjoys mental health and well-being.

*****

simple way to express it, though, is to describe mental health as our ability to remain in a “river of well-being.”

*****

bank of rigidity

*****

So one extreme is chaos, where there’s a total lack of control. The other extreme is rigidity, where there’s too much control, leading to a lack of flexibility and adaptability

*****

The longer we can avoid either bank, the more time we spend enjoying the river of well-being

*****

Harmony emerges from integration. Chaos and rigidity arise when integration is blocked.

*****

You can guide her back into the flow of well-being so that she can achieve better balance within herself and move into a more integrated state. (Don’t worry—we’ll offer you plenty of ways to do this.)

*****

If you see chaos and/or rigidity, you know she’s not in a state of integration

*****

when she is in a state of integration, she demonstrates the qualities we associate with someone who is mentally and emotionally healthy: she is flexible, adaptive, stable, and able to understand herself and the world around her.

CHAPTER 2

Two Brains Are Better Than One

Integrating the Left and the Right

*****

power lean,” putting all of her baby-grand weight on Thomas’s leg

*****

best way for Thomas to respond? His immediate goal: come up with a strategy to get Katie to willingly attend school again. That was his “survive” goal. But he also wanted to turn this difficult experience into an opportunity that would benefit Katie in both the short and the long term. That was his “thrive” goal.

*****

your brain is divided into two hemispheres

*****

function very differently.

*****

left brain loves and desires order. It is logical, literal, linguistic (it likes words), and linear (it puts things in a sequence or order

*****

The right brain, on the other hand, is holistic and nonverbal, sending and receiving signals that allow us to communicate, such as facial expressions, eye contact, tone of voice, posture, and gestures.

*****

basic idea is that while the left brain is logical, linguistic, and literal, the right brain is emotional, nonverbal, experiential, and autobiographical—

*****

very young children are right-hemisphere dominant, especially during their first three years.

*****

they live their lives completely in the moment—which is why they will drop everything to squat down and fully absorb themselves in watching a ladybug crawl along the sidewalk,

*****

Logic, responsibilities, and time don’t exist for them yet. But when a toddler begins asking “Why?” all the time, you know that the left brain is beginning to really kick in.

crucial that our two hemispheres work together.

*****

corpus callosum is a bundle of fibers that runs along the center of the brain, connecting the right hemisphere with the left.

*****

horizontally integrated

*****

Using only the right or left brain would be like trying to swim using only one arm

*****

When we’re upset, it can feel safer to withdraw from this unpredictable right-sided awareness and retreat into the more predictable and controlled logical land of the left.

*****

allowed myself to feel what she was feeling, then tried to communicate from my right brain to her right brain. Using my facial expressions and posture, I let her know that I was really tuning in to her emotions

*****

This is how I tried to connect with both her right brain with its feelings, bodily sensations, and images and with her left brain, with its words and ability to tell the linear story of her experience.

*****

When the raw emotions in their right brain are not combined with the logic of the left, they will be like Katie, floating too close to the bank of chaos

*****

how do we promote horizontal integration in our child’s brain

*****

two strategies you can use right away when “integration opportunities” arise in your family.
