### FORMULAS FOR MIRACLES: AN INTRODUCTION BY JOE VITALE 3

- if there is something you are trying to achieve—you name it—and you aren't achieving it, chances are your Unconscious holds some contradictory intentions for you


### INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION BY STUART LICHTMAN 5

- , I typically describe each process in a number of different ways that are similar but differ in important aspects.
	- l note that some Chapters have a B, C or D suffix, denoting different cuts at the same material
- twice annually, I will still send you a constantly revised and expanded series of Newsletters. expand on material here

### HOW I RAISED 2.5 MILLION DOLLARS, DIED FOR 8 MINUTES, AND DEVELOPED THE CYBERNETIC TRANSPOSITION TECHNIQUES: A FOREWORD BY STUART LICHTMAN 7

-  student at M.I.T. in 1957,  my new advisor appeared in the form of Dwight Baumann. his wife, Mavis

- One of the businesses that I had started was called Recognition Terminals, formed in 1969, and I’d intuitively used an early version of the Cybernetic Transposition techniques to almost instantly generate the $2.5 million in investment funding that I required
	- created an Imaginary Experience of someone, an investor, happily giving me a check for $2.5 million. focused on the investor, in my imagination, repeatedly asking him for his name and how to contact him

- PhD dissertation: Arintel system - same 12 clusters of Unconscious personality types.

- Three big “aha” types of breakthroughs
	- human brain could be viewed as a massively parallel computer system, each of the component neurons functioning as both a digital and analogue computer
	- power of such a system was millions of times greater than the most powerful supercomputer
	- could teach people to use this system so that they could do seemingly impossible things

- Near death experience -->: 2h daily meditations --> my meditations frequently began to include the “receipt” of “packets” of information, each of which was an “aha” experience --> how he got most of CT

- creating and running companies ->  lots of opportunities to observe and model people, how they succeeded and failed--> Ed Brower

- Cybernetics means to me, “the human use of human beings,” the title of cybernetics’ creator Norbert Wiener’s second book on the subject.
- Transposition means the basic technique of transposing a success in one area of life into a success in another area

### IMPORTANT NOTE 16
### CHAPTER ONE: THE NEW WAY TO ACHIEVE ALL YOUR DREAMS 21


- have to read, understand, and use the ideas in this book.
- "program" yourself, using any past success you've had and you "own" as valid (in your own mind) as the only condition you need
- don't need more schooling.... or more experience... or personal connections...or to be born into a rich family... or any other preconditions you might have thought you needed to have money
- All you need is a previous success you recognize in your own mind as being a success
- Cybernetic Transposition relies on whole-brain harmonizing,
	* the left brain (words, logic)
	* the right brain (patterns, symbols)
	* the mid-brain (emotions)
	* and the brain stem (physical stimulation)
- conflict, the disharmony, the competing agendas of these four parts of the brain that keep you from achieving your goals
- I’ll be teaching you to change that, to bring your Conscious Mind into the loop so it, in a sense, becomes the steersman.
	- cybernetic - steersman
	- transposition - interchange
- No more hit or miss. You'll give it an assignment and it will go to work for you instantly

- what, you ask, are you going to be measuring on the “1 to 10” scale?
	- Desirability — a “1” means “totally undesirable, the pits” and a “10” means “totally desirable, wouldn’t change it for all the tea in China – it’s perfect for me.”
	- Difficulty — a “1” means “nearly automatic” and “10” means “nearly impossible based on logic and experience.”

- At this point, you might start considering what you want to have, do, or be
	- begin dreaming right now

- the basic three steps for Basic Achievement:
	-1) Create a Target
	- 2) Prioritize your Target
	- 3) Resolve any self-defeating Unconscious habit patterns
-  driving a car is a simple example. And you’ve already accomplished it, most likely.

- resolving Unconscious habit patterns”— Clearing the Unconscious

- You don’t have to believe this is going to work

- modest goal or target : Basic 3 step (Basic Achievement)
- impossible desire --> Super achievement


### CHAPTER TWO: BASIC ACHIEVEMENT STEP 1 - HOW TO SET YOUR FIRST TARGET 34
- you’ll move far beyond typical goal setting, and learn to create the kind of target that practically pulls you to it
- most people’s experience with setting goals is negative. It brings up images of toil and hard work – definitely not fun or enjoyable
- next eight chapters will teach you how to use the Cybernetic Transposition Basic Achievement Three Step Process to attain any challenging (but not impossible) desire you may have

- How to Set Your Target
	- parts of your brain are pulling you in different directions because they each speak a different language:
		- The right brain is fluent in patterns of arrangement, pattern, rhythm, and sound.
		- The left brain's language is made up of words and logic.
		- The midbrain communicates in emotions.
		- The brainstem’s language consists of physical stimulus and response.

- Unless you can persuade all four parts of your brain to pursue your goal, you probably won’t achieve it! 
	- And whenever you fail to achieve your goal, you establish and reinforce a pattern

- you’re about to get all parts of your “team” to work together to help you achieve the target you choose

-how to get mentally aligned:
	- most effective way to harmonize the different parts of your mind is to start with a remembered experience and rewrite it so it exactly describes what you want.
		- daydream or rewrite an actual memory into a “perfect” picture using your remarkable skill of hindsight
		- start with actual memory --> give it a desirability score ( 1-10) --> thats your meta-story
		- rewrite the memory to make it a perfect 10 --> the instruction to your unconscious

- Exercise --> recall a past experience that got you money (recall all the pertaining details.. good and bad):
	- was it a "10"? if not, rewrite it to become a 10 ( delete the bad part, add good, desirable stuff) -- >the perfect version of what happenned
	- get clear, crystal clarity on the awesome experience 
	- now your mind has a very desirable memory on making money --> turned conflict energy into productive unconscious cooperation

- how to create Metastory that is a target:
	- 1) start with main objective
	- 2) notice what comes to mind
	- 3) mix remembered stuff and imagined stuff
	- 4) polish your story to become a '10' --> get note of the blockers 
	- 5) rewrite as many times as you need to make it a perfect 10 on desirability -- add or delete stuff

- get careful with too wonderful , maybe out of reach metastories
	- ex: doubling or tripling annual income may be more achuievable thatn making it 100x higher

- now, create you BA target
	- difficulty : no tougher than 4
	- 1) write your BA obejctive:
		- ex: 'I will make $5k teaching online finance basics for a group of people' 
	- 2) respond and react to you BA Objective ( feelings, ideas, reservations, enthusiasms):
		- fears of not knowing
		- not being able to follow up 
		- technical problems
		- no structure
		- excitement with theme
		- feeling like scamming ppl?
	- 3) write a screenplay of memory /imaginary scene
		- what tasks you perform?
		- what results you want and achieve?
	- 4) make sure that what you describe involves onlyu your OWN actions
		- you can involve other ppl actions if you were capable of this before
	- 5) use you gut feeling and rate desirability (1-10)
	- 6) test for false 10--> is it too unrealistic? make it achievable and posible--> rewirte until 'false 10' feeling disappear
	- 7) rate how difficult it would normally be for you to produce this result
		- if diff above 4: rewrite to get it donw
		- if rewriting 'ruin' your target, let it aside to SuperAchievemetn
	- 8) take some insurance:
		- 'Please make this happen in  ways that are for the highest good of me and everyone else involved.'
		- Please make this or something better happen in ways that are for the highest good of me and of all concerned.
 
- now you got your desirable Meta-Story --> time for step 2 
- next chapter you'll get a broader understanding of developing metastory ( step 1)

### CHAPTER TWO – B: SETTING EFFECTIVE BASIC CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS TARGETS - STEP ONE OF THE CYBERNETIC TRANSPOSITION THREE-STEP 56

- this is another, enhanced, point of view for step 1 of 3 
- a Sufi saying, “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will take you there.”

- to set a BA Target (step 1 of 3), do the following
	- 1) Write a brief list of what you want to accomplish
	- 2) Home in on the first difficult or seemingly impossible thing on that list. That is, what you think should come first timewise
		-  choose a SINGLE very precise thing and record it
	- 3) Remember a time when you were experiencing something close to the positive response you just described. It could be in a very different context and that’s fine. Record what you get.
	- 4) Now, using your wonderfully powerful skill of hindsight, edit the written description you just recorded in step 3 to demonstrate you expressing the same sort of feelings in the situation you described in step 2.
		- use the present tense ( unconscioius live in the now)
		- this starts Preliminary BA target
	- 5) Try to imagine yourself actually doing what you described in Step 4. 
		- As you do, be alert for any other feelings of upset or impossibility, any Blockers operating.
		- describe blockers in writing + body sensations
	- 6) Read over your written description of what you want, your preliminary BA Target, to identify the specific words or phrases that trigger these signs of Unconscious conflict, these Blockers. Underline or circle these words or phrases.
	- 7) To the extent that you are now able, edit your preliminary BA Target by rewriting the words or phrases that triggered the Blockers and anything else relevant until you feel a sense of rightness and positivity when you read them.
		as you continue edition, youree prompting unconscious to keep coming with acceptable alternatives
	- 8) generalize target for all similar situations

- harmony will be evident in your Unconscious Mind’s feedback to your Conscious Mind in the form of feelings of desirability, appropriateness, joy and loving
- blockers will be solved in step 3 of 3 

### CHAPTER THREE: BASIC ACHIEVEMENT STEP 2 - HOW TO MAKE YOUR TARGET MORE IMPORTANT THAN DISTRACTIONS – STEP TWO OF THE CYBERNETIC TRANSPOSITION THREE-STEP 65
- Distractions can take away the best of us—if you don’t know how to make your target more important than them!

- 1st) check if your target is a difficulty 4-:
	- if higher, 2 options:
		- rewrite to make it 4 or less
		- save it for SuperAchiever 3-step in chapter 6

- keeping focus is naturally hard

- REPETITION is the most effective way of prioritizing BA-Target
	-think of a song that stuck in your head from infancy --> lots of repetition

- exercise --> look every day at you perfect 10 metastory from step1
	-also if your difficulty is 3-:
		- 1) sit down with your target statement
		- 2) Imagine and experience what your target describes, read silently , create a movie in your head
		- 3) read through it 100 TImes --> aloud or explicitily talking to yourself ( make sure no one overhears you, so you protect from negative comments)
			- keep count on a separate paper
			- if during reading, you realize you can make you BA Target stronger: make changes clear in your mind ands revise original
			- the fewer and shorter interruptions, better
		- 4) notice blockers --> they interrupt natural flow
			- write them on separatre piece of paper
			- any type of negative or resisting thought, and keep the reading
	- if difficulty is 4+:
		- -same steps as before, but you need to write 100x by hand
		- best to do 100 at one sitting, but okay to do min of 25 perday for 4 consecutive days
		- and then one repetition every day until you achieve your BA Target

- take note of reason if YOU DONT WANT TO DO IT
	- maybe desirability is not perfect 10 yet
	- must be plasurable to relive it
	- keep note of blockers found : feelings and thoughts

- if youre not ready to write 1000x -->  write your BA Target 5 – 10 times to get a feel for the process
	- only to feel the resistance that builds within you --> your unconscious ringing the phone
		- pick up the phone and answer the msg
		- 
### CHAPTER THREE – B: PRIORITIZING YOUR TARGET – STEP TWO OF THE CYBERNETIC TRANSPOSITION THREE-STEP 77

- memory by repetition --> activated by a cue
	- focus and repetition

- when you like a song--> becomes easy to repeat and memorize it
	- prioritizing BA Target should be fun

- 100 writings (dificulty 4 or 5) / reading (dificulty 3 or less) in a day or 25 in 4 consecutive days

- prioritizing does 2 things:
	- make your unconscious focused
	- triggers blockers

- rewriting/ editing solves the imagination blockers
	- there are body feelings blockers also that must be dealt with
		- ex: feeling asleep, headache, feel its stupid

- body feelings are dealt using a base reframing process ( chapter 4c)
	- redirect self defeating to self-supporting

- exercise: take records of all those blockers: imagined and body feelings
	- keep editing until you get a perfect 10
	- frame the blocker through writing --> then resolve with Base reframing

- exercise: create imaginary experience of having just achieved your BA Target --> add in any peripheral experiences taht support your imagined experience
	-surround this imagined experience with ball of light and bring it toyour heart chackra (center of your chest)
	- finish with insurance statement: “This is the way I would like things to be. Please make this happen in ways that are for the highest good of me and everyone else involved.”

- writing syncs unconscioun feelings with conscious abilities

- exercise for after the 100 repetition:
	- 1) keep writing readind BAT at least once until you reach it - >take note of any blockers that pop up --> record trigger words
	- 2) rate your certainty of achieving it
	- 3) keep rewriting until it feels perfect
	- 4) create a 10-level Imaginary experience of having just achieved it --> anchor it --> surround with a ball of light and absorb it into your heart chackraa
	- 5) state the insurance: “This is the way I would like things to be. Please make that happen in ways that are for the highest good of me and everyone else involved.”  

- base reframing is the imaginary experience of having the blocker solved --> do it with one blocker per day, those taht cant be solved by editing

### CHAPTER FOUR: BASIC ACHIEVEMENT STEP 3 - HOW TO RESOLVE UNCONSCIOUS CONFLICTS THAT WOULD NORMALLY BLOCK REACHING YOUR BASIC ACHIEVEMENT TARGET 83

- learn how to eliminate your blokcers forever --> resolving them

- unconscious is constantly sending feedback to conscious .. be it with thoughts or bodyt feelings
	- blockers signal disharmony within you
	- blockers waste energy away

- list of common blockers:
	- Headaches, body pains, acid stomach
	- Insomnia, oversleeping
	- Fatigue, sluggishness, drowsiness
	- Anger, fear, upset
	- Confusion, difficulty understanding
	- Difficulty concentrating, difficulty focusing
	- Boredom, loss of energy
	- Nagging feelings that something is wrong


- body harmony feels like:
	- Feelings of well being, contentment
	- Eagerness, enthusiasm, alertness
	- High energy
	- Joy, loving, happiness
	- Clarity, understanding

- blockers show up when you want something but cant get it

- common ways of dealing with blockers:
	- shuting up conscious: alcohol, drugs etc
	- forced conscious will --> the battle drains us
	
- you can AVOID or RESOLVE blockers
	-AVOIDANCE: rewite BA TArget to make things in a way you can avoid blockers
	- RESOLVE: use Base Reframing (chap 4c)

- THe POVs
	- consciuous: what you say you want
	- unconscious: what you get


-POVs conflict generate all blockers: bad thoughts and feelings
	- they are like a ringing phone -> they are good

-Use the already mentioned BA Clearing process ( editing until you blockers are solved) -- >circle/ underline segments that cause you blocking feelings
	- signinficant changes made means reprioritizing -->:add 20 to 50 more repetitions

- how to check if you got a perfect 10?
	- feelings of joy and happiness when imagining achieving it
	- enthuisiams and eagerness everytime you think about it



### CHAPTER FOUR – B: HOW TO IDENTIFY BLOCKERS? 100
- love, joy, upliftment, abundance, fulfillment and enthusiasm are our natural state. Any deviation from that state is 
caused by Blockers

- 3 types of blockers:
	- minor: operational issues --> use SA Clearing Process --> CTColorProcess in ch6
	- moderate to very intense: personal issues or emotions --> reactivenes and improper behavior ( solve blockers into supporting unconscious habit patterns, ch4c and ch10)
	- extremely internse and life long: "always/never" kind of personal identifications --> cell level memories
	- 

### CHAPTER FOUR – C: CYBERNETIC TRANSPOSITION STEP THREE - RESOLVING BLOCKERS VIA THE BASE REFRAMING PROCESS 103

- Base reframing Process
	- chapter 10 will have a more powerful version
		-SA rot Normal Base Reframing Process
		- SA Subpersonality Negotiation process

- How blockers are formed? --> survival issues
	-whatever worked eh nyour survival was at stake becomes encapsulated --> same situation = same habit
	
- Base reframe transforms self defeting unconscous pattersn into self supporting ones

- gut feelings --> blockers --> literal changes from what you consider normal

- unconscious habit pattern means a set of multi body feelings ( example a headache may mean some pain ver the eye and on temples and apressure around nose,etyc

- differentiate body feelings from labels
	- you must effectively capture and frame the body feelings to proceed with Base reframing

- How does Ba base freframing works?
	- start with framed Blocker Body feelings --> move down to earlier memories of its formation
	- design a replacement behavior pattern that reflect your desired future response to the initial stiumulus that trigger blocker , based on your current wisdom
	- instruct part of your uncscious a subpersonality that express desired behavior when it wouyld otherwise express the blocker

- How to frame blocker body feelings
	- really focus on a memory --> body goes into state --> beware it may trigger the undesired response
	- step1: check indirect singals and body sensations: blood flow, body tenstions, feelings of stress ,. antecipation--> focus on the experience and write brief description of it --> scan body from head to toe -> flip back and forth from experience and body check --> not thoughts , only changes in your body
	- step2: rtecord blçocker body feelings in a sheet of paper
	- step 3: rate how clear adn concrete blocker body feelings were recorded. 1 to feel nothing and 10 tocapture all as holding a pen --> only proceed with base reframing if you get an 8+

- problemns for not readhing an 8:
	- 1 unscoscious doest know what to focus on
	- 2 blocker associated with feelings

- 1 unscoscious doest know what to focus on
	- the stream of consciousness --> the log in the flowing river
	-  the tune-up process
		- 1) rate blocker body feelings: clarity + concreteness (1-10)
		- 2) must be at least an 8.
			- if <8 -->record your feelings
			- check what you need to reach a 10
				- ask your unconscious to make it more clear and concrete so to reach a 10. add the insurance
			- you may have blockers with physical feelings
				- use a drawing of a body and point where felings are located and describe them.
