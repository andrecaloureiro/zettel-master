Sequences compensate for the lack of a topical hiearchical order by clustering notes that could at some point become a topic or sub-topic.

Notes that generate enough follow-up notes will become topic notes, with the potential of several sub-topics developing under the topic.

Once enough notes have built up around a topic they become the foundation for future writing.
