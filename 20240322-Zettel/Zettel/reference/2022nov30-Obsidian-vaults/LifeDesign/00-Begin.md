			- dont get personal if they dont comply
				- possible reasons:
					- trust
					- price
	- as detailed as possible ( immersion)
		- immerse EXECUTION of action plan
	- feel and describe the benefits of reaching point B
		- immerse ACHIEVEMENT of goals
		- find your new, expanded set of rights and duties

- seek blocks on the way A ->  B

		- persisting block?
			- keep a log
			- find support forum/peers
