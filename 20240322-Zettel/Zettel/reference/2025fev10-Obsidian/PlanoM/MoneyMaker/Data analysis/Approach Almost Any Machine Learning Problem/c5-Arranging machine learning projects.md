- this book will works with Ide/text Editor rather than Jupyter
	- jupyter for EDA and chart/graph plot
	- code to make problwemas as plug and play
	- improve models with git

- tHE STRUCTURE ODF a project folder:
	- input
		- train.csv
		- test.csv
	- src
		- create_folds.py
		- train.py
		- inference.py
		- models.py
		- config.py
		- model_dispatcher.py
			- to dispatch different ML models
	- models
		- model_rf.bin
		- model_et.bin
	- notebooks
		- exploration.ipynb
		- check_data.ipynb
	- readme.md
	- license

- implemented train.py
	- using config.py file to set input and output files
	- using model_dispatcher. py to select between model to apply 
	- saving/dumping the trained .bin
