This program constitutes an overall lifestyle plan which is made  up of specific interventions to address specific problems that arise in terms of health and fitness

Energy Balance Equation:

Eucaloric

*****

Hypercaloric

*****

Hypocaloric

*****

Any sort of effective intervention which seeks to tap into stores of visceral and body fat must manipulate that energy balance equation in the other direction

*****

like your household budget

*****

We can restrict the calories-in side by eating a low-calorie diet. And we can increase the calories-out side by using strategies to make our bodies burn more calories

*****

Chapter 2Failed Attempts

*****

CardioNow

*****

Which is more feasible: To forgo a peanut butter sandwich or to dedicate 2 hours to a treadmill every day? The effect on the energy balance equation is the same.

*****

low-calorie diet holds first place in terms of losing fat.

*****

longer we remain in a caloric deficit, the more our bodies adapt to functioning in a lower-calorie environment, and our metabolisms slow down

*****

Our body is remarkably adaptive and suited for survival. It has built-in defense mechanisms against  death by starvation, aimed at reducing caloric needs in times of caloric deprivation

*****

you can certainly manipulate the calories-out side by increasing energy expenditure through activity

*****

Cardio is often used toward this end for a couple of reasons. It requires virtually no extra equipment. One can simply go outside and take a walk. Also, it is a low-intensity activity that can be kept up for a relatively long time

*****

Why Do We Regain Weight?

*****

metabolic adaptation”,

*****

If 1000 calories a day is your new maintenance level (where calories-in = calories-out), what happens when you begin eating 1500 calories a day? Well, at least initially, until your  body begins healing and adapting, you will store those extra 500 calories a day in your storage tank:

*****

cardiovascular health improved you actually become more efficient in converting calories into activity and therefore get diminishing returns in terms of calorie burning from the same level of activity.

*****

Chapter 3The SolutionMuscle-Building

*****

pie chart above,

*****

way to increase your largest driver of total daily caloric expenditure—your Resting Metabolic Rate?

*****

It's actually relatively simple. Build muscle.

*****

Muscle burns calories at rest. Muscle does not only burn calories during intentional physical activity, like cardio. No, muscle burns calories merely by existing

*****

bigger engine burns more gas all the time, active or idling.

*****

This is the secret to effective, long-term body change. Building a bigger motor causes you to burn more gas forever, even at rest.

*****

Burning Calories inside the workout (comparison

*****

Cardio exercise utilizes aerobic respiration to turn the energy we eat (calories) into energy we can use (ATP)

*****

Resistance training of the type advocated here in our program utilizes the glycolytic energy pathway to make the same conversion (calories → ATP).

*****

are trying to use as many calories as possible—not conserve them and spend them very efficiently and miserly

*****

have easy access to far more calories than I actually need for activity.

*****

Post-workoutSo

*****

After your heart stops beating fast, you are in the same state as you were before you spent your hours on the treadmill.

*****

After an intelligently designed resistance-training workout, you have activated muscle protein synthesis.

*****

This bodily process goes on for the next 24-48 hours while you rest. As a process, it costs energy

*****

initiated a bodily process which goes on for the next 24 – 48 hours, and this process requires extra protein from the food you eat as well as extra miscellaneous calories to be converted into ATP to fuel this proces

*****

really is the difference between spending your time and investing your time

*****

actual mass of muscle tissue which most closely correlates with increasing resting metabolic rate.

*****

cross training, training for several different goals at once, will not be as effective for body composition change as a laser-focused effort on one specific goal at a time.

*****

building bigger muscles, adding skeletal muscle tissue to your frame

*****

Endurance, health and strength will all progress as a side effect, and then we can more sharply focus on other things we want to improve.

*****

fixes the vast majority of health problems and health markers that act as predictors for future disease.

*****

aMPS

*****

what we need to do is to trigger muscle protein synthesis in order to put our body into a muscle-building state.

*****

Muscle Protein Synthesis activator

*****

breaking down” muscle tissue is the last thing we want to do

*****

you simply need to provide enough mechanical tension on a particular muscle group to trigger muscle protein synthesis.

*****

intelligently designed workout regimen can provide this stimulus for all the major muscle groups in your body with several 15-minute amps spread out over the course of a week

*****

we advise using aMPS every 24-48 hours. In practical  terms, this means we advise doing a 15-minute aMPS workout every day if possible.

*****

we split all the major muscle groups into three different workouts which we call “Push workout”, “Pull workout”, and “Legs workout”, six days on and one day off works out perfectly

*****

each major muscle group twice over a week's time and take a full rest day

*****

Workout Regimen StructureThere

*****

irst let’s discuss how we should organize particular workouts into a comprehensive regimen

*****

full-body

*****

split

*****

I think for  90% of people 90% of the time, a split routine is superior.

*****

splitting my muscle groups into parts, I can work SOMETHING every day

*****

body is perpetually in a muscle-building state

*****

long workout leaves me tired. A short workout energizes me and gets me pumped for the rest of my day—for “real” life outside the gym

*****

most common split routines are “Upper/Lower”,

*****

Push/Pull/Legs

*****

muscle groups individually (e.g. Arm Day, Shoulder Day, Chest Day, Back Day, Leg Day…).Bro-splits are generally looked down upon by exercise scientists

*****

I tend to favor Push/Pull/Legs most of the time

*****

important for you to understand the basic mechanical patterns for each movement so that you can select particular exercises that fit.

*****

interchangeable as long as you follow the movement pattern and present a real challenge (in terms of level of effort) to the targeted muscle groups

*****

1.  “Push” Workout

*****

horizontal

*****

vertical

*****

2.  “Pull” Workout: This describes

*****

Horizontal

*****

Vertical

*****

3.  “Leg” Workout

*****

squatting

*****

hip-hinge

*****

If we walk a little more than usual, this is usually sufficient stimulus for calf developmen

*****

ProgressionIn

*****

continually provide a greater challenge to those muscles.

*****

let's say I do 10 push-ups today

*****

sooner or later, my muscles will grow and adapt to the stimulus provided by 10 push-ups. Then, they require a stronger stimulus.

*****

homeostasis

*****

provide progressively more challenge.

*****

do more reps

*****

add weight

*****

add more sets

*****

Those are the three main variables

*****

make sure that the overall course of our workout regimen includes some sort of progression over time

*****

first step is always a focus on exercise frequency

*****

step number two will address level of effort (intensity

*****

Even though we're only exercising 15 minutes, it should be a difficult and challenging 15 minutes.

*****

pay attention to their last five reps of every set.

*****

second way I build progression into a client program: intensity

*****

training for size is slightly different than training for pure strength.

*****

next way I like to progress their routine is by adding sets. This increases the total volume of work they do

*****

Each of the three variables—sets, reps and weight—increase volume

*****

adding sets is the easiest way to significantly increase volume.

*****

there is a certain intensity below which muscle protein synthesis is simply not triggered

*****

Junk Volume”:

*****

becomes necessary to reduce the amount of rest between sets as the number of sets increases.

*****

In general, I advocate resting enough to completely catch your breath between sets

*****

becomes acclimated to the workout regimen, one’s general conditioning improves to support somewhat shorter rest periods; so I am able to progressively reduce the amount of rest between straight sets from an initial time of two minutes down to 90 seconds and again down to about 60 seconds.

*****

Myo-RepsThe

*****

only the last five or six reps which really provide the mechanical tension challenge that stimulates muscle growth.

*****

If you do a set of 20 reps for an exercise, how challenging are those first 10 reps

*****

Those first 10 or 15 were really just warm-up; they really just serve to tire you out to where the last 5 reps are challenging at all.

*****

begin with a fairly light weight that you can get 20 reps with

*****

Myo-reps begins with an “activation set” of 20 reps

*****

you only rest about 10 seconds, and then try to get five or six more reps.

*****

you would rest ten seconds again, and then get another five reps

*****

You get much more work done in much less time utilizing myo-reps.

*****

solid exercise progression would follow this pattern: 1) frequency, 2) intensity, or level of effort, 3) adding sets and reducing rest, and 4) myo-reps

*****

sample workout that shows one way to incorporate these principles into a concrete routine, see the resources section appended at the end of this book

*****

Dietary Support

*****

Exercise is simply the event that stimulates the body process which follows

*****

which converts protein that we eat into protein that we wear, skeletal muscle tissue

*****

you simply cannot build a brick home without bricks

*****

bare minimum dietary support for building muscle is adequate dietary protein intake.

*****

What about carbs and fat?

*****

Each of them largely is just a source of energy.

*****

How about carbs? T

*****

insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance and insulin response

*****

Insulin is like a little key that unlocks the doors to the cells so that glucose can pass into them

*****

more glucose that's in your blood at any one time, the more insulin is released by your pancreas in order to move that glucose into your cells

*****

eating too many carbs over a prolonged period can indeed have serious deleterious health effects.

*****

The dose is the poison

*****

lower body fat levels and moderate carbohydrate intake.

*****

If we eat a high protein diet and couple it with an appropriate calorie target, carbohydrate and fat levels will take care of themselves

*****

you may even have heard about leptin and ghrelin, luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone, or HCG.

*****

Fix the source of the pollution, and the river is no longer being fouled in the first place!

*****

Body Recomposition

*****

Body Recomposition is a term that means gaining muscle and losing fat at the same time

*****

Your body seeks equilibrium. The further you are away from a "normal state", the easier it is to move towards that normal state,

*****

it would be best to separate dedicated muscle-building phases from dedicated fat-loss phases.

*****

Sine-Wave Diet™

*****

You do not have to meet a calorie target every single day. Instead, what is important is your calorie average over the week

*****

Tracking over time is the most accurate way to find your maintenance calorie level

*****

These calculators use several different equations, but the most advanced is the Mifflin-St Jeor equation ^c89329

*****

common consensus is that it takes about a 500 calorie daily caloric deficit in order to lose a pound of body fat per week.

*****

two pounds a week is about the maximum recommended by the scientific literature

*****

get to live like a real person, and you have a sustainable diet model that you can keep up over the few weeks that it takes to execute a dietary intervention.

*****

As long as your average calorie intake is close to your goal, then what's the problem?

*****

every time you drop calories, your body will attempt to adapt and function at that lower calorie leve

*****

Whenever a week goes by without you seeing a new low on the scale, it's time to implement one of these small drops

*****

continue to add challenges in caloric intake to force your body to tap into its fat stores to supplement the caloric deficit.

*****

minimum calorie threshold that you need to eat in order to keep up basic bodily functions

*****

between 800 and 1200 calories, depending on your body size.

*****

*****

most effective length of time for fat-loss diets are anywhere from 6 to 12 weeks. I

*****

prolonged low-calorie diet has absolutely crashed their metabolisms as well as their hormone levels. People are literally in starvation mode.

*****

cortisone levels (the stress hormone) is through the roof, and their thyroid levels (which to a large extent regulate metabolism) are absolutely bottomed out

*****

Metabolic Priming™

*****

first thing we have to do

*****

feed them and heal them. We call this Metabolic Priming™

*****

What better market is there than a bunch of sweaty, starving people who are utterly frustrated with all the time, work, and suffering they are putting in day after day to no avail?

*****

They focus on hormonal imbalances, which are all direct results of a prolonged starvation diet. They focus on products and stimulants that can marginally boost caloric expenditure (like caffeine) in order to address the slowed, sluggish metabolism which is a direct result of a prolonged starvation diet

*****

go for the root of the problem, move ourselves from a state of ill health to health, and then see what symptoms persist from there.

*****

body is remarkable in its capacity to heal itself when everything is working in balance and in order as it was designed to work.

*****

give your  body a break. We aim to reduce body fat by about 10% each dietary cycle.

*****

After losing 10 to 20 pounds of fat over an 8 to 10 week diet, you need to reverse diet—slowly raise your calories back up to maintenance levels in order to allow your body to recover, heal and prepare for the next dietary cycle.

*****

You must raise your calories slowly over the course of a few weeks and then stay at a good, healthy maintenance level for about another four weeks

*****

be ready to go another round on the diet, and lose another 10% of your body fat.

*****

That low calorie diet that we just came out of has put our bodies into the perfect position to gain a good bit of muscle during our short diet break. This too is a golden opportunity

*****

maintenance periods to build up muscle tissue and then you use the low-calorie diet periods to wash off body fat.

*****

Those four weeks at maintenance will be like an oasis in the desert

*****

if you just make it a couple more weeks, you'll be eating pizza and ice cream.

*****

RecoveryNo

*****

recovery completes the three pillars of success in terms of body composition change.

*****

as long as the stimulus meets the minimum threshold of “flipping the switch” to activate Muscle Protein Stimulus, the stimulus is adequate to meet our goals.

*****

any kind of physical activity is indeed a stressor. It stresses the body.

*****

any sorts of physical activity introduce stress on the body and require time,  sleep and nutrition in order to recover.

all boil down to one thing--calories in vs calories out.

when you select your initial 500 to 1000 calorie drop, make sure your target number is not less than 1700 for a man or 1200 for a woman. That leaves us a little room for further tweaks later on throughout the 12-week program

*****

Behind calories, protein is the next biggest factor in your diet

*****

at least 20 grams of protein independently stimulates muscle protein synthesis.

*****

eating 20 or more grams of protein in a meal is like getting a small mini-workout in.
