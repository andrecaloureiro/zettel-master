# Marketing - product Launch Formula - Jeff wAlker

- A Note to the Reader
    - [http://thelaunchbook.com/member/](http://thelaunchbook.com/member/)
    
- Chapter 1: From Stay-at-Home Dad to 6 figures in 7 days
    - I’m talking about is creating a business (or building an existing business) and generating profits right out of the gate. A business with low overhead, low start-up costs, and minimal or no staff. A business that is highly profitable and gives you great flexibility in your life.
    - Every successful product, business, and brand starts with a successful launch.
    - It’s never been easier to get started, and it’s never been easier to grow a business
    - One of the people I met at that seminar was a man named John Reese
    - In 2004, John put my techniques to work on two launches. The first one was for a three-day seminar he put on

- Chapter 2     Food Stamps to Six Figures: The Product Launch Formula Explained
    - PLF is all about the method, not sinking a lot of money into the launch.
    - $360 in sales vs. $20,100. Now just to be crystal clear, John didn’t spend anything on advertising during his PLF-style launch.
    - when you combine any list with PLF, it’s almost like having a license to print money.
    - you break free of the trap of trading your precious time for dollars.
    - These businesses focused mostly on providing “information” that fell into two categories:
    - information that solved a problem
    - content that provided entertainment
    - The Product Launch Formula® is a system to get your target market so engaged with your product (or business) that they almost beg you to sell it to them. And this all happens before you even release the product.
    - we’re going to focus on three huge changes:
        - 1. Speed of communication
        - 2. Cost of communication:
        - 3. Interactivity:
    - before a new product release, all the Apple fanboy sites are full of breathless rumors about when the release will be, the actual product to be released, and what new features to expect.
    - buzz and excitement BEFORE THE PRODUCT IS EVER RELEASED.
    - Huge anticipation surrounds the launch, and people are genuinely engaged and paying attention.
    - So instead of shouting at your prospects, what if you engaged them in a conversation?
    - crazy idea to put together a course that teaches my ‘secret’ method.
    - before I create the course, I want to make sure I really cover everything.
    - Asking that question starts a conversation.
    - but you’ll see soon enough how that inauspicious start can build into something that almost takes on a life of its own.
    - The military uses a term they call “the fog of war.” Well, as a business person or marketer, you’re competing in an environment that I call the “communication fog.” You have to find some way to cut through that fog or your business will perish. It’s that simple.
    - take a quick look at the primary sequences in PLF:
        - 1. Pre-Prelaunch:
            - use it to start building anticipation among your most loyal fans
            - used to judge how receptive the market will be to your offer
            - figure out what some of the primary objections
            - pre-prelaunch can even be used to tweak your final offer.
        - 2. Prelaunch:
            - three pieces of high-value, Prelaunch Content.
            - activate mental triggers
            - all that while you answer the objections
            - Typically delivered over 5-12 days
        - 3. Launch:
            - we call this “Open Cart,
            - starts with the email that basically says, “We’re open, you can finally buy now,
            - goes from 1 to 7 days
        - 4. Post-Launch:
            - clean-up sequence
            - follow up with both
                - your new clients
                - prospects who didn’t buy from you
            - if you do it right, the post-launch starts to set up your next launch.
            - where you deliver value and build your brand
        - Story: How Humans Communicate
            - If you want to make your business and your marketing memorable, then your marketing needs to tell a story.
            - This is one of the hidden weapons of PLF, because the most powerful way to communicate your message is with a story, and the serial nature of your Prelaunch Sequence is a perfect place to tell that story.
        - The Final Piece of the Puzzle: The Mental Triggers
            - vast majority of our decisions and behaviors are based in emotion and mental programming—and then we use our precious logic to justify those decisions
            - number of mental triggers that influence those decisions and behaviors.
        - Putting It All Together
            - compelling and memorable story that cuts through the marketing fog, a story that connects your offer to the hopes, dreams, fears, and aspirations of your prospect.
- Chapter 3     A License to Print Money: Your List
    - What I had was almost the equivalent of a license to “print” money whenever I needed it. I had an email list of clients and prospects, and that list gave me the ability to create income on demand.
    - When my wife and I decided to move out of the Denver area, the timing wasn’t ideal.
    - My first thought was “What type of offer can I make to my email list to raise that kind of money quickly?”
    - That’s the power of the list. It means that you have the ability to create a big payday on demand. And that’s exactly what I did.
    - The Golden Strategy
        - List building is one of the core strategies I always focus on in every business I own
        - obsessive focus on building your list of clients and prospects,
        - In the online world, your list is everything.
        - And for really large lists (I have well over 100,000 subscribers,
        - ake extra precautions so that whatever website you are sending people to doesn’t crash
        - power of having a list. You can actually send so much traffic to a site that you overwhelm the server.
        - having a list is like having a license to print money at will
    - What about Spam?
        - many definitions of spam out there, and what is regarded as spam has changed quite a bit over time
        - spamming is a very quick way to put yourself out of business. Don’t do it
    - Your List Is Not a Strategy, It’s the Strategy
        - another thing that set me apart from the majority of other people who were building lists, and that is summed up in one word: Relationship.
        - They’ll start asking me about the stuff I’ve shared from my personal life in my emails
        - that’s a good thing, because I want my readers to feel like they have a personal connection with me.
        - There are lists out there where 60% or more of the people on the list open the email. That’s on the super-responsive end of the spectrum.
        - building a responsive list, but it really comes down to “relationship.”
        - easiest way to increase the responsiveness of your list is to increase the connection and relationship you have with your list.
    - What about Social Media?
        - email still has the real power
        - email list of 1,000 people will outperform a Facebook following of 20,000.
        - Another problem with building lists on social media sites is that you are not in control of the platform.
        - list is actually owned by Facebook, and they can change the rules any time they want.
        - Your list will become the biggest asset in your business,
        - When you build a list on a social media site, you have two big dangers.
        - site might change the rules in how you can use your list,
        - they might close down your account altogether.
        - social media site might actually lose its reach, and people might abandon it
    - A Buyer Is a Buyer
        - email lists are much more powerful than social media lists.
        - Another critical distinction is between “prospect” lists and “customer” lists.
        - prospect is someone who has NOT bought anything from you yet.
        - buyer is someone who HAS bought something from you
        - you will have both types of lists
        - person on your buyer list is worth 10 to 15 times what a person on your prospect list is worth.
        - 1st: try to move people from your prospect list to your buyers list
        - 2nd: treat the two lists differently
        
- Chapter 4     The Sideways Sales Letter: How to Sell Your Stuff Like Crazy without Being “Salesy”
    - Sideways Sales Letter™
    - with greater connectivity, people have become more highly tuned to authenticity.
    - everyone is walking around with a giant super-sensitive “BS Detector” that’s always on full alert.
    - old way of selling doesn’t work so well anymore.
    - When most people first encounter a long form sales letter, they have one of two reactions
    - topic they are interested in and it’s a good letter that’s been written by a pro copywriter, they’ll start reading it and soon get sucked right into the narrative of the letter
    - advertising legend Albert Lasker,
    
    - An oldo tool For new profits
        - within a few years sales letters became really popular online. In fact, they got even longer on the Internet, because you didn’t need to pay for printing
        - The long sales letter has morphed into a long sales video. Think of it as a 20- or 30-minute commercial.
        - Instead of pages, I used days. Instead of a 10-page sales letter, I used a 10-day sequence.
        - nstead of one super-long letter, I split it up into a series of contacts over a number of days. We call those contacts “Prelaunch Content” or “PLC.”
        - Instead of delivering the equivalent of a super-long monologue, I turned the whole process into a conversation . . . a launch conversation.
        - At its core, the Sideways Sales Letter™ is a sequence of Prelaunch Content, followed by a sales message.
        - typical sequence will have three pieces of Prelaunch Content, which you share with your prospects over a period of up to 12 days.
        - often online video, but it can take any number of forms, such as email or blog posts or PDF reports
        
    - Stpping off the Work train and Onto the leverage Train
        - He created an online membership site called “Get More Corporate Gigs” where his clients could get ongoing training for a monthly subscription fee of $37.
        - The Sideways Sales Letter gives you the luxury of time to communicate the true value of your offer.
        - first piece of Prelaunch Content to quickly build rapport with his readers and demonstrate that he really understood their pain.
        - real pain point that Barry addressed in his prelaunch (i.e., his Sideways Sales Letter) is that the average entertainer is terrified that they might be forced to get a real job.
        - first piece of Prelaunch Content showed his prospects that he really understood them, because he had the same hopes, dreams, and fears as they did.
        - You can see Barry’s first video at this link: [http://thelaunchbook.com/barry](http://thelaunchbook.com/barry).
        - Launch Conversation,” because when you post your Prelaunch Content, you will generally do it on a blog where there’s a place to leave comments below the video
        - conversations are almost always a lot more interesting than monologues
        - comments also give you some incredible insight into what your prospects are thinking and feeling
        - chance to answer those objections, both in your comments and in your subsequent pieces of Prelaunch Content.
        - second prelaunch video, he revisited the potential pain of failing at the business, then he really focused on teaching.
        - fundamental principles and methods of marketing themselves as entertainers.
        - If you’re going to sell at the premium end, the best way to attract high-end clients is to deliver massive value upfront.
        - by sharing great content in his prelaunch videos, he established the authority he needed
        - If you’re worried that lots of people won’t buy after they watch your prelaunch, then you’re absolutely right. Most of your prospects won’t buy.
        - his third prelaunch video, Barry reviewed his launch story and he stepped up the teaching even more. He actually reviewed web sites for various entertainers, and he showed the mistakes they were making
        - started to make a pivot to the sale.
        - Often people who are putting together one of these launches get so caught up in delivering great content that they don’t want to talk about the sale in that final prelaunch video.
        - three videos were delivered over a period of six days. And when Barry opened up registration, he sold out all 15 spots almost immediately for a total of $29,955 in sales
        - made nearly $60 for every person on his email list!
        - Barry has re-run the very same launch with the very same videos four more times. Each time he has put between 15 and 18 people into his class
        - took another big step up in terms of leveraging his time. He reduced his price to $997 when he did this, but it meant that each additional sale took absolutely no extra time to fulfill.
        - product that provided enormous value to his clients . . . and he didn’t have to travel to any shows to do it.
        - gives you the time and space to connect with your prospects and deliver real value. I
        
- Chapter 5     Weapons of Mass Influence: The Mental Triggers
    - results my students are getting today are even better than back when I first started teaching Product Launch Formula.
    - big part of the reason the model keeps working is that we have continued to evolve the tactics.
    - even bigger reason is that the success of this product launch model is due to the integral STRATEGIES that we use, and those strategies are timeless
    - power of the Product Launch Formula is that it gives you a canvas on which to activate these mental triggers as you move through your launch.
    - Hit these triggers over and over in your Prelaunch Sequence and your Launch Sequence, and you can create a nearly hypnotic spell over your prospects (and even your entire market).
    
    - With Great Power comes great responsibility
        - nine of my favorite mental triggers
            - Authority
                - it pays to be seen as an authority
                - shockingly easy to create authority.
            - Reciprocity
                - reciprocity is the very basis from which humans were able to create commerce and trade
                - trust me when I say that one of the worst feelings in the world is when a friend or neighbor shows up at your house with a gift for you, and you don’t have a gift for them
                - During a PLF-style launch, you spend the entire prelaunch giving to people
                - great, free content.
                - several cycles of reciprocity, of giving and receiving before you even get to asking for the order.
            - Trust
                - if you want to influence someone, it’s much easier if they trust you. If you want to get someone to do something, it’s much easier if they trust you
                - One of the easiest ways to create trust is through time
                - these tools give you time and repeated interaction with your prospects.
            - Anticipation
                - Anticipation is one of the triggers that allows you to cut through the marketing fog. It lets you grab your market’s attention and not let go
                - Time seemed to slow down as the big, anticipated day approached. It was all you could think about. You couldn’t wait for that day
                - if you do this right, your launch is almost like mixing together your prospect’s birthday and summer vacation all in one bundle.
                - Anticipation is also closely tied to “events” where you’re circling the date on the calendar and focusing all your attention on that date.
                - people will put the date on their calendar and look forward to your launch.
            - Likeability
                - we enjoy doing business with people we know, like, and trust
                - When you’re seen being gracious, kind, generous, and honest . . . well, people will like you more.
                - People generally like to do business with other people more than with a large faceless corporation
            - Events and Ritual
                - turn your marketing into an event (which is what running a well-executed PLF-style launch is all about)
                - When people go through an event together, it becomes something of a ritual.
                - ritual is a cornerstone for nearly all religion
            - Community
                - We act in accordance with how we think the people in our community are supposed to act
                - If you reflect on your own life, I bet you can think of many communities you’re part o
                - You can actually build your own online community right in the midst of your launch. Once you get people interacting with you, with your marketing, and with each other, you’re on your way to forming a community
                - you can create your own community norms
                - actions like helping spread the word about your Prelaunch Content,
                - comments
                - liking” your posts in social media. Or even buying your product.
            - Scarcity
                - one of the most powerful mental triggers in existence, period
                - perception of scarcity that motivates us.
                - force people to make a decision.
                - some negative consequence if people don’t take action
                - INSIST on using that tactic in EVERY launch you do, it will literally pay you back 10,000 times what you invested in this book.
            - Social Proof
                - idea that if we see other people taking action, then we will be inclined to take that action as well
                - It’s 7PM and you drive into a strange town
                - When someone new to your site sees other folks making comments on your Prelaunch Content—saying how excited they are about your launch and how they can’t wait to buy your product—that is social proof in action, and it’s incredibly powerful.
            
            - Layering and Sequencing: taking mental Triggers to the Next Level
                - influence our actions on a very fundamental level all day long, each and every day.
                - go deeper on the mental triggers, I’ve got a video for you at this link: [http://thelaunchbook.com/triggers](http://thelaunchbook.com/triggers).
                - trusted authority.”
                - scarcity and social proof. I
                - Another key point about mental triggers is that they are more powerful when you sequence them and layer them on top of each other
                - the way we do launches gives you the time and space to use multiple triggers and to have them build on top of one another.
                - When you share strong compelling content at the start of your prelaunch, you instantly develop authority
                - also develop reciprocity when you do this
                - anticipation going for you, as you talk about everything else that’s coming up in your prelaunch.
                - get close to your open cart date, you hit the event and ritual triggers
                - people start to anticipate y
                - natural time to hit the scarcity trigger,
- Chapter 6     The Shot across the Bow: Your Pre-Prelaunch
    - one of the areas that’s almost always overlooked is the “pre-pre”—because it’s the most clandestine
    - whole idea of the pre-prelaunch is to begin to activate your tribe—or start building a tribe if you don’t have one yet
    - testing the market’s level of interest in your product idea
    - surface potential objections so you can answer them during your prelaunch.
    - gathering information to help finalize your product offer
    - all of this while setting the stage for your Prelaunch Sequence.
    - call your pre-prelaunch the “Shot Across the Bow,”
    - Pre-Prelaunch Sequence is all about grabbing your market’s attention without actually trying to sell them anything at all.
    - my tool of choice for the pre-pre has historically been a simple email or two, although these days social media has also become a big part of the pre-pre for many launches.
    - few times where I’ve used video, and sometimes I’ve thrown a survey into the mix.
    
    - The Ten Pre-Prelaunch Questions
        - these are the top ten questions that are running through my mind
        - 1) How CAn I let ppl know something is coming without feeling like I am trying to sell them?
            - idea here is to begin the conversation about your product WITHOUT overtly selling it.
        - 2) How can I tease their curiosity?
            - start to engage your prospects’ curiosity early on, you’ll keep them interested for the entire launch.
        - 3) How can I get their help in creating this product? How can I make this collaborative?
            - get people engaged and create the feeling like they’re part of the process
            - now moved them from prospects to cheerleaders.
        - 4) How can I figure out what their Objections are to this product?
            - You might THINK you know what their objections are, but you don’t really KNOW what they are until you start engaging with your prospects.
            - With the pre-pre you’re going to find out what they are early on
        - 5) How can I start to engage my prospects in  a conversation about my offer? How can I be engaging and avoid the “corporate speak” that will kill my launch before it starts?”
            - this is where you set the stage for the entire “Launch Conversation,”
        - 6) How can I make this funs and HUmorous and even exciting?
            - your job of keeping people’s attention in a crowded market will always be challenging.
            - ticking “attention bomb.”
            - Think of humor or surprise as an instant attention reset.
            - Every time you get your prospects to laugh or smile, it sets that ticking “attention bomb” back to zero, and you’ve gained some precious extra seconds.
        - 7) How can I stand out in a crwoded market? How can I be different?
            - I never want my marketing to be like other people’s marketing.
        - 8) How can I figurre out how my market wants to be sold?
            - folks in your market aren’t walking around “wanting” to be sold to. And you’re right, they’re not. But they are walking around with problems
            - hopes, dreams, desires, and fears
            - They want solutions. And if you have a solution, they certainly want to buy it from you.
        - 9) How can I figure out my exact offer?
            - truth is that you need to create a great offer.
            - to be a success, you need a crushing offer.
            - your pre-prelaunch is a key to creating a crushing offer. Because if you ask them the right way, your prospects will tell you how to create a great offer.
        - 10) How can this naturally lead into mu Prelaunch Sequence?
        
    - My Favorite Pre-Prelaunch Strategy
        - elegant strategy to find the right answers with just an email or two.
    - Quick Announcement and a Favor
        - Email example is given
        - The start of the pre-prelaunch came in a simple, plain old email that was only 80 words long.
    - They landed on a simple web page that said:
        - HOWEVER, we need your help.
        - there is really only one thing we want to ask you …
    - super-short email that sent people to a super-short survey.
        - I definitely let people know something was coming, and I did it without any hint of a pitch.
        - curiosity
        - telling them something was coming that they couldn’t get yet
        - telling people that the manual was “long-awaited” sets the expectation that people are already curious about and eagerly anticipating this produc
        - Was this product really long-awaited? I don’t know.
        - built up a list of people who had asked me to create this product.
        - working on the project for a long tim
        - enough for me to call it long-awaited.
        - giving my readers a chance to help create the product.
        - reciprocity mental trigger?
        - short email and a short survey,
        - figure out what their objections are
        - find two or three or maybe even four common themes that keep showing up in the responses.
        - Quick announcement and a favor . . . “ When was the last time a big corporation asked for a favor in their email?
        - How can I stand out
        - asking my readers for their feedback before the product was released,
        - people support that which they help create.
        - figure out how my market wants to be sold
        - survey
        - mix up multiple choice questions with essay questions. Y
        - essay questions will give you quite a bit more insight. And that insight will often tell you how to construct your Prelaunch Sequence and your Launch Sequence
        - enter the conversation that’s already taking place in your prospect’s mind.”
        - figure out my exact offer?”
        Again, the answer to this question is in the survey responses.
        - gather data throughout the pre-prelaunch and the prelaunch to help me fine-tune the offer.
        - calls are delivered after the launch, it took zero effort to add them to the offer.
        - wrote to my list again. I thanked them for the overwhelming response and told them how excited I was to have the project almost complete

    - if you get only the core principles right, the results can be dramatic
    - You can see my Case Study with Will, along with an example of his prelaunch video content, at [http://thelaunchbook.com/will.)](http://thelaunchbook.com/will.))
    - solid introduction to the crazy influence of mental triggers.
    - time to get down to the nitty-gritty . . . the Prelaunch Sequence.
    - The thing to remember about your prelaunch (and the entire Product Launch Formula) is that it’s not a one-trick pony. It’s the confluence of all these tools that create an incredible conversion machine for your business
    - t’s about designing a great offer for a great product that’s going to create great value for your clients.
    - launch process is a coordinated, engineered formula that will transform your sales process. T
    - started with your pre-prelaunch, and now we’re going to really turn up the heat with your Prelaunch Sequence.
    
    - Buy my Stuff , buy my stuff
        - there will always be people who can shout louder, or shout longer, or sell at a lower price. You don’t want to be fighting that battle.
        - Instead of screaming for attention, you attract attention by giving value before there is any hint of asking for the sale
        - Life gives to the givers and takes from the takers.” I
        - You need to structure your content into a sequence that naturally builds up to your sale.
    - Your Pre-launch Sequence
        - framework for the overall story arc is
        - start off teaching people about the opportunity for change or transformation.
        - follow that up with some solid teaching, and you show that transformation or change
        - Finally, you give the “ownership experience.”
        - talking about your product and the impact it will make on your prospective client.
        - move through the launch, you’ll naturally start to build Trust
        - start to build Community
        - taking your prospects through this entire sequence together, it becomes a shared experience that hits the Events and Ritual trigger.
        - the Anticipation will start to build
        - the magic is in the process. Success doesn’t depend on you being a gifted copywriter or master salesperson.
        - if you do this correctly, you will have garnered a list of prospects who can’t wait for the moment when they can finally buy your product.
        - Your PLC can be delivered via email or as blog posts or as PDF reports or audio.
        - video content often has a higher perceived value than other types of content.
        - two primary types of video: screen-capture video and full-motion video
        
    - PLC #1: The Opportunity (or the Journey)
        - must answer the all-important question “Why?
        - Why should your prospect care? Why should they spend their precious time paying attention to you? Why should they listen to you? What can you do for them?
        - you need to focus on the end benefit that your product will create for your prospect
        - either taking away some pain from your client . . . or you’re delivering some pleasure.
        - People want to buy an end result. Doesn’t matter what you’re selling
        - tool is just a means to get that result.
        - You’re buying the destination, not the means of transportation.
        - people don’t buy from you, the first and most common reason is that they’re not interested in what you’re selling
        - they don’t have the money. They just simply do not have it, and they have no means to get it. T
        - they don’t believe you.
        - they don’t trust either your ethics or your competence.
        - they don’t believe the product will work for them
        - here’s a general recipe that works well for PLC #1:
            - opportunity
            - Position
            - Teach
            - Raise objections
            - Foreshadow PLC #2
    - PLC #2: The Transformatio
        - PLC #1 was all about the “Why,” your second piece of Prelaunch Content is all about the “What
        - some type of tip or trick that is truly valuable.
        - doesn’t have to be a huge change or huge impact—just get them moving.
        - most of my viewers don’t immediately go out and do a Seed Launch after they see that video, but I want to give them enough training so that they can at least see themselves doing one.
        - get your prospect to see themselves having the transformation that you promised in PLC #1, then you’ve done your job.
        - Here’s the general recipe for a strong PLC #2:
            - who you are and why they should listen to you.
            - deliver some real value for your viewer
            - top two or three objections and answer them
            - let them know you have another video coming soon.
            - Ask for a comment on your launch blog or in social media.
    - PLC #3: The Ownership Experience
        - So PLC #1 was the “why” and PLC #2 was the “what.” Now in PLC #3 you will start to answer the “how” question.
        - usually they still don’t see how they’re really going to have that change in their lives. Well, the ultimate answer is to buy your product, and by the end of PLC #3, they’re going to see that answer
        - you need to do throughout your Prelaunch Sequence is to build the excitement and tension.
        - rising action
    - story is clearly building and moving toward a climax
    - here’s the recipe for PLC #3:
        - go ahead and answer those questions that keep popping up in the comments on your blog.
        - What’s the ultimate transformation or change that your prospect can have in their life if they buy your product?
        - You don’t want to go from being their best friend in one video to a used-car salesman in the nex
        - they still haven’t seen your offer
        - three-part Prelaunch Sequence.
        - build a warm relationship with your prospects, you’ll demonstrate massive authority, and you’ll create all kinds of reciprocity.
        - launch conversation” as your prospects leave comments on your blog.
        - also give you some strong insights into your prospects’ big objections
    - Case Study Caution
        - get an expert’s opinion.
        - United States Federal Trade Commission published new guidelines about the use of testimonials—specifically testimonials that have any results-based claims.
        - plenty of murkiness around this topic.
        - consult an attorney to see if you’re in compliance with the FTC regulations and guidelines.
    - Your Pre-launch timing
        - How long should it be? How long between each PLC? The answer, unfortunately, is that it depends
        - had prelaunches that lasted anywhere from three days all the way up to 27 days.
        - good starting point is seven to ten days.
        - $27 ebook, then I would tend toward the short end—seven days or possibly even five days
        - higher-priced product, say a $297 training course on getting a job on a cruise ship, then I would move toward the longer end and go with ten days.
        - timing isn’t nearly as important as the Prelaunch Conten
    - One critical Thing that makes this work
        - way you put together a great Prelaunch Sequence is by delivering massive value to your market
        - focus on only one thing, it should be creating value for all the prospects going through your Launch Sequence.
        - giving real content that creates real value for people.
        - Teach them about the opportunity in your first PLC, but go beyond the opportunity
        - real content that people can actually use.
        - get comments from people who are shocked at the amount of content I give out.
        - hundreds of people who have done successful launches just based on the free material that I’ve given out during my prelaunch.
        - no way I’ll ever sell to everyone, so I might as well create as much value as I can as I move through my life.
        - closely tied to the amount of value that you create in the world

    successful international business as a dog trainer, sending her to Europe, Australia, and New Zealand to work with her students.
    
    Susan was already looking for a way to cut back on her travel schedule—and then her husband suffered a heart attack.
    
    How could she continue to reach her clients who were spread throughout the world? And how was she going to replace her lost income if she stopped traveling to give training workshop
    
    she didn’t have a product or a list.
    
    no technical skills whatsoever. But the one asset she had was an enormous will to succee
    
    she knew she needed a list host, so she signed up for my hosting service at [ProFollow.com](http://profollow.com/) ([http://www.profollow.com](http://www.profollow.com/))
    
    formatted them into an ebook, and she priced it at $14.97
    
    her prelaunch was entirely email-based.
    
    Since that time Susan has built out an entire line of dog training products, and they’re priced anywhere from $47 on the low end all the way up to $4,997.
    
    Susan now has a team helping her build her business, and they’ve made the lives of tens of thousands of dogs—and dog owners—a whole lot better.
    
    PLF is an easy button for creating a great sales process for your product, but you have to put in the effort
    
    If you’ve followed my formula, you’ve raised their interest level to a peak state. And naturally, your emotions and energy are going to be in a peak state as well.
    
    friend who is an astronaut and has traveled to the International Space Station three times
    
    his account reminded me of the feeling that comes with a well-executed product launch
    
    whole tone of the comments coming in on the launch blog shifted from questions about the content to questions about the offer. That’s always a good sign.
    
    As the visitors to the site sat and watched the timer, we sat and watched the server stats
    
    tats on how many people were on the site, what page they were on, and how long they had been on that specific page.
    
    over Skype to my launch team that said, “They’re heeeeeeere and they want to buy!”
    A few minutes later we went live right on time. The reaction was immediate. We were over $100,000 in sales in minutes, we hit $500,000 in the first hour

    final piece of PLC had a strong pivot
    
    your prelaunch has already completed most of the heavy-lifting for you in terms of making the sale.
    
    strong sales page.
    
    important not to skimp on your sales message.

    The “PS” is often the single most read part of an email, and I used it to hit the scarcity trigger, warning my readers that they shouldn’t dela

    sigh of relief when the first order comes in, because it means everything is working properly.
    
    hour or two watching stats. I watch the traffic on the site, the traffic to the actual order form, the opens and clicks on the launch email, the number of orders, and the details behind the orders (which option people are choosing).
    
    Typically, you will want to keep your launch open somewhere between four to seven days.
    
    times I’ve completely sold out all of my product in as few as 24 or 36 hours.
    
    For your first launch, just plan on keeping your cart open for five days.
    
    typically you’ll get about 25% of your orders in the first day and about 50% of your orders on the final day

    1. The offer goes away
    
    using these types of scarcity are not about manipulation.
    
    Ending your launch with an exclamation mark—meaning some form of scarcity that instills a sense of urgency—is the way you do that.
    
    Here’s how to use email to keep your launch in front of your prospects.

    two emails—the first when you open the ca
    
    second about four hours later to let your list know that everything is up and running

    be absolutely clear about when you’ll close and what your prospects stand to lose if they don’t act before the launch offer closes down
    
    Day Five
    
    two (or even three) times.
    
    first one is sent early in the morning reiteratin
    
    second email
    
    about six to eight hours before the cart closes.
    
    You need to send more than one email on closing day.
    
    Occasionally a launch can underperform.
    
    give you a few pointers on what to do when your launch doesn’t go well.
    
    It’s possible to crash your web site server if you send too much traffic
    
    if you do have a serious business with a large list, then this is definitely something to pay attention to.
    
    Make no mistake, server crashes are not fun. You can see my current list of recommended web hosts and servers on the Resource Page at [http://thelaunchbook.com/resources](http://thelaunchbook.com/resources).
    
    sudden huge influx of orders, it can make them nervou
    
    huge increase in orders over your normal rate will scare your merchant account provider.
    
    best way to avoid these troubles is through a lot of communication before your launch.
    
    And you should also do business with a “launch friendly” merchant account provider
    
    For a current list of my recommended providers, check out the Resource Page at [http://thelaunchbook.com/resources](http://thelaunchbook.com/resources).
    
    No One Buys
    
    When it does happen, it’s time to go into diagnosis mode.
    
    start testing your process
    
    go through the sales process at your site and make sure everything is working
    
    determine whether you’re getting any traffic to your site.
    
    if everything is working on the site and you’re getting traffic to the site and you’re still not getting any sales, then you’ve got a conversion problem
    
    two primary reasons for conversion problems
    
    either your offer or your sales message
    
    possibly be a combination of both.
    
    First let’s look at the offer.
    
    Are you selling something that the market desperately wants
    
    offer address your prospects’ hopes and dreams?
    
    fears and aspirations in the market?
    
    consider the sales message in your sales video or sales letter
    
    articulate the transformation or the change your product offers to your prospect
    
    benefits in your product come alive?
    
    benefits feel tangible and concrete?
    
    simple and understandable
    
    what they’re going to get?
    
    offer problem or a sales copy problem, then it’s time to get to work
    
    I’ve seen remarkable turnarounds right in the middle of the launch due to a tweaked offer and/or a reworked sales page.
    
    What to Do after Your Launch
    
    amount of goodwill that you will create
    
    big chunk of the market will
    
    Those people are your tribe, and your prelaunch creates a great self-selection process for identifying that tribe.
    
    you will want to strengthen your relationship with those who bought from you.
    
    use it to extend your momentum and positioning from your launch.
    
    huge effort to over-deliver to my new clients, and I suggest you do the same
    
    have a few extra bonuses that I never mentioned during my launch
    
    adding something extra makes you stand out in the market
    
    just give more than you promised.
    
    much of this can be done through automated follow-up emails.
    
    customer service. I provide world-class customer service, and it’s worth every penny

    I’m sure you can see the power of a well-orchestrated product launc
    
    proven system that’s worked over and over for businesses of any size.
    
    while this all makes sense, you don’t know how to get started
    
    don’t have a list
    
    you don’t have a product
    
    Seed Launch because it’s a little launch that can grow a product, a list, and even a business
    
    like many launches it was driven by a serious need
    
    I had a partnership break apart very abruptly.
    
    by their very definition, none of them can last forever.
    
    he would be taking almost all of our paying clients with him
    
    first thing I did was sit down and think about what type of business I wanted to create next
    
    I now know that a 10% response rate is at the lower end of what you should expect after you make an offer from stage, and I had gotten less than 3%.
    
    it was far more important to get a “critical mass” in the class than to extract every last dollar out of it, I extended the invitation on a complimentary basis
    
    when you’re an expert on a topic, you often suffer from “the curse of knowledge.” Y
    
    I asked my audience what they wanted to know. As part of my offer, I promised five teleclasses. But before I did even the first one, I surveyed my 30 students to learn their most burning questions about product launches
    
    five broad categories to correspond with the five calls I would make
    
    Before the next call, I ran another survey. I asked my students if they had any questions about the material I covered in the first call. And then I asked them for their top questions about the second topic—creating the Prelaunch Sequence
    
    that process for each call—wash, rinse, repeat.
    
    added an extra bonus call where I answered any additional questions my students had.
    
    obsessed with over-delivering on my promises, I added a few extra Case Study calls where I walked through examples from some additional launches.
    
    doing nine or ten calls instead of the five I had promised
    
    some terrific testimonials and several successful Case Studies from my students.
    
    It was because I let my students guide the process. I continually asked them, both on the calls and in the surveys before each call, what they needed to know
    
    lot of products come to market. And many of them are not very good. Using the Seed Launch removes the worry that you’re going to create a lousy product.
    
    interactive process to build your produc
    
    naturally become attuned to your market’s need. T
    
    ideal launch if you’re just starting out and you don’t have a list or a product.
    
    also great if you have an idea for a new product, but you aren’t sure of the demand for it or you would like to get paid for a product before you create it
    
    this style of launch doesn’t work for physical widgets.
    
    already learned nearly all the tools and concepts that you need in your Seed Launch
    
    I once did a launch to a list of 299 people. I was trying to make one of the most difficult sales ever by taking an online service that had originally been free and charging for that exact same service. And the new price was not inexpensive, but $100 per year.
    
    Seed Launch capitalizes on is that in every list there’s a percentage of people known as “hyper-responsives.”
    
    first step in your Seed Launch is to build some type of micro-list. That list might have only 30 people, but it would be better if it contained more like a hundred people. And three hundred would be even better.
    
    pulling together a micro-list like this has never been easier, and your most-effective tool is social media
    
    post good content about your topic on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and whatever new darling emerges in the social media world.
    
    attract followers by publishing relevant interesting content about your topic.
    
    content you create or content you curate (i.e., stuff from others that you find and repost).
    
    aim for one hundred to three hundred. It’s really not very hard
    
    your offer is going to be a series of teleseminars.
    
    easiest way to start is with teleseminars.
    
    Plan on doing one per week. Also plan on doing a surprise bonus “Question and Answer” call just to make sure that you over-deliver to your new clients.
    
    you do need to have a good offer, and you need to do a good job of explaining the benefits people will receive from your class
    
    focus on the transformation or change people will experience by going through your training.
    
    show your clients how you’re going to help them reach their dreams and aspirations and/or avoid their fears and frustrations.
    
    What will the final outcome be? Will they finally be able to play songs for themselves and their friends?
    
    With the Seed Launch you want to keep things simple, beginning with the pre-prelaunch.
    
    putting together an actual survey or via email or social media.
    
    tell you a lot about the hopes/dreams/fears/frustrations of your market
    
    sets the stage for your offer and starts to build awareness and even anticipation of your coming offer
    
    next step is an email follow up, where you talk about some of the findings and conclusions from your survey.
    
    your own journey of transformation,
    
    early challenges and how you overcame
    
    your upcoming class
    
    next email is where you make your offer. Generally, you will want to direct people to a sales letter or sales video.
    
    still have to work hard to explain the benefits, and you still need to focus on the ultimate transformation or change that your new clients will experience.
    
    you don’t sell 30 spots, do what I did with my Product Launch Workshop and discreetly invite a few people to participate on a complimentary basis
    
    I’ve seen Seed Launches for products between $50 and $3,000 (depending on the market and offer), so your financial results are going to vary dramatically from person to person and from offer to offer
    
    as you deliver your product, remember that feedback and surveys are your friend. I survey people before each call
    
    top questions about the next topi
    
    go through the responses, group them into themes, and rewrite them into good questions that you can expand into teaching points.
    
    logical and compelling order
    
    you’re building a product to perfectly match what your market wants
    
    getting deep insight into your market and how to talk to your market
    
    you’re going to be recording these calls
    
    you can get those audio recordings transcribed. Each hour of audio will equal about 15 to 20 printed pages, so you’ll have the makings of a book (or ebook) that’s 90 to 120 pages long.
    
    focus on getting your new clients some strong results, because they’re going to be great candidates for Case Studies as you move forward and get ready to launch your product in a bigger way.
    
- Chapter 10   How I Made a Million Dollars in a Single Hour: The JV Launch
    
    where is the line between fear and panic?
    
    this time I wanted a business where I had complete control, where I didn’t have a partner to consult every time I had a new idea or plan.
    
    my income wasn’t tied to the number of hours I worked but to how well I could sell my products
    
    also in love with the impact I could make
    
    crowded market. There were thousands of people who were trying to make a living as an Internet marketing expert
    
    market in which I had no positioning or traction.
    
    there are lots of ways to build a list, but the single fastest way to do it is by using the lists that other people have already built and curated
    
    In a JV Launch you have partners mail their lists and tell their people about your launch
    
    your JV partners will mail their list and encourage their readers to visit your Prelaunch Conten
    
    visitors have to join your list before they get to your PLC.
    
    you end up building a serious “launch list” out of all those leads.
    
    list size is completely dependent on your niche, who your partners are, and the size of their list, but it’s possible to add thousands of people to your list in just a few days during a JV Launch.
    
    you have to treat your JV relationships like gold. And that’s why I was extra nervous as the minutes ticked away before my open.
    
    Within the first hour, I had already done more than $70,000 in sales. By the end of the first day, after only 14 hours, the sales were over $200,000.
    
    One of the biggest costs in a JV Launch is your affiliate commissions
    
    I was paying 50% of the sale to my referring partner
    
    price was $997, so I paid a commission of $498.50 for every sale that a partner referred to me.
    
    commission varies by launch, by market, by niche, and even by partne
    
    you pay your commission AFTER the sale is made
    
    With JV or affiliate relationships, you pay based only on the results, and you pay after the sale is made.
    
    I know almost all of my JV partners personally, and during a launch I’m communicating with them closely—always via email and often on the phone or via text. Many of them are close friends of mine.
    
    there are some core elements you need to have in place before you even think about a JV Launch, and there are many mistakes to be avoided
    
    just like you, your potential JV partners are in business to make a profit.
    
    if they have a strong list they probably have more opportunities to promote offers than they can possibly accommodate
    
    And if they don’t have a strong list, they’re not going to be a very good partner, so you shouldn’t be bothering with them.
    
    anyone with a substantial list most likely gets requests every day to promote someone else’s product.
    
    Launch Sequence is such an incredible conversion machine, you’re going to be generating some outsized results
    
    One of the ways this is measured online is in EPC—or “earnings per click”—
    
    if someone sends 100 clicks, and those clicks generate commissions of $450 for the partner, then that’s an EPC of 450/100, or a $4.50 EPC.
    
    an EPC will vary depending on the market and offer
    
    solid PLF-style launch is an EPC-generating monster.
    
    when your partners promote your offer, they’re going to be watching their numbers, meaning they’re going to be watching their EPC.
    
    If they tell the people on their list to go watch your videos, and your videos are boring and content-free, it will negatively impact what those visitors think about your partner.
    
    partner has real skin in the game.
    
    f the results from their promotion aren’t good, then they probably won’t be promoting for you again in the future. B
    
    you need to be sure you have an offer that converts.
    
    Internal Launch first. In other words, first run the launch for just your list (even if you have a very small list).
    
    That way you get to test your Launch Sequences and your offer. T
    
    what’s truly critical is that you have the opportunity to test your offer and your Prelaunch Sequence to make sure you’ve got a winner.
    
    If you have an offer that isn’t going to convert, you want to be the one taking that bullet.
    
    if you’ve got a tested and proven offer (i.e., an offer that you ran an Internal Launch for), and you can show them your results, then they’re going to be a lot more interested in mailing
    
    I’ve spent entire days teaching about finding and nurturing JV relationships
    
    you don’t need thousands, or hundreds, or even tens of JV partners
    
    80% of your results come from 20% of your effort.
    
    99% of your results come from 1% of your partners
    
    we’re extremely selective about who we take on as partners—we take on only top tier partners.
    
    top three affiliates might generate a quarter of our sales.
    
    I always tell them to not worry about getting a lot of affiliates but to get three to five high-quality partners that will really support them.
    
    They are the other people who are publishing in your market.
    
    type the top keyword search for your market into Google
    
    Go to each of the top 50 listings and look around their site for a way to opt in.
    
    if you join 50 lists (and you should), you’re going to be getting a lot of email
    
    watch what they send to their subscribers.
    
    Try to reverse-engineer their marketing and their offers
    
    you need only three to five high-quality partners, although you might need to approach 50 potential partners
    
    good JV partners always have more people who are trying to get them to promote than they could possibly support. That’s a reality of business.
    
    you need to create some value for them if you want to stand out.
    
    One of the best ways to build value for potential partners is to have a great Launch Sequence that generates a lot of commissions for them
    
    you need to find other ways to create value just to get on their rada
    
    promote their product first—if you generate a bunch of sales for them, then they will definitely take notice
    
    Another easy thing you can do is buy their product, put it to use, and then give some constructive feedback and/or a positive testimonial.
    
    also give them regular feedback on their blog and in social media.
    
    long-term effect of the increased positioning
    
    rapid list growth will reverberate in your business for years to come.
    
    remember the two things I’ve hammered on throughout this chapter.
    
    build long-term relationships with your JV partners
    
    create real, long-term value for those partners.
    
    when I first rolled out Product Launch Formula in 2005 and the launch generated just over $600,000.
    
    bunch of happy partners to whom I paid some big commission
    
    generated a list of more than 15,000 people
    
    gave me huge positioning in the market.
    
    two-plus years of supporting and nurturing my JV relationships, I had a lot of support to call on
    
    We hit a million dollars in sales in 53 minutes.
    
    There’s only one thing that surpasses the JV Launch, and that’s the Business Launch Formula …
    
- Chapter 11   Creating a Business from the Ether: The Business Launch Formula
    
    Ruth Buczynski is a licensed psychologist who runs the National Institute for the Clinical Application of Behavioral Medicine ([NICABM.com](http://nicabm.com/)).
    
    hurt many businesses, including Ruth’s. Her primary source of sales and revenue was her conferences—and it was becoming more and more difficult to convince people to get on a plane and travel to live events.
    
    worth noting that while Ruth is a licensed psychologist, she is not the “expert” in her trainings. Instead, she brings in world-class experts such as Daniel Amen, Ram Daas, and Daniel Goleman.
    
    Ruth actually gives away the bulk of her content—if you’re willing to be on each webinar live, then you can listen to all of them without spending a single dollar. But lots of people pay for the extra benefits and bonuses that come with the Gold level.
    
    three or four different virtual events a year, including one on mindfulness, a second on brain science, and another on the treatment of trauma.
    
    invited to a meeting (along with other leaders in her field) to discuss ways to help the U.S. Army with mental health services for their troops
    
    Surgeon General of the U.S. Army was watching Ruth’s Prelaunch Content!
    
    by now we’ve established that PLF is an incredible tool for launching your products and services
    
    PLF is not just about launching products. It’s about launching businesses
    
    reality is that the training goes much deeper. In fact, the way I like to think about it is that I help them reprogram their business DNA
    
    When someone comes into my PLF program, my personal goal for them is to do a year’s worth of sales in a single week with their launches
    
    launch generated a huge amount of goodwill, and it also helped add a lot of new leads onto his list
    
    took the momentum from that launch and used it to sell his herbal kit, which was a physical product
    
    helped raise his stature and positioning in the market, which in turn helped him build his list even more
    
    each launch, the tremendous interaction with his list (i.e., the launch conversation) helped him pinpoint what his next product should be
    
    John put together a major new product: the membership site [LearningHerbs.com](http://learningherbs.com/).
    
    They each pay about $12 a month for access to the membership site.
    
    significant and automatic monthly recurring income—a revenue stream that he could count on.
    
    he could begin to hire people, and he slowly started to build his team.
    
    John is now a major player in the herbal education market.
    
    he’s more the person who brings the experts to his followers
    
    couple of times per year, John will launch an entirely new produc
    
    John will typically relaunch his membership site once per year.
    
    each launch grows his list and his positioning in the market to an even greater degree.
    
    constantly delivering value into the marke
    
    constantly building a relationship with your clients and prospects
    
    stimulating the conversation
    
    always getting ideas for new products and promotions.
    
    That’s the Business Launch Formula.
    
    now that she had the beginnings of an email list, she decided to sell it herself.
    
    She’s now created a series of video training products that are all offered online.
    
    She opens her trainings several times per year. She always uses PLF to deliver great value during her prelaunch—and to fill up her programs
    
    grown to an impressive 16 times larger than it was before PLF.
    
    No longer was he just some kid fresh out of college with a tennis web site. He had become a dominant player in the tennis instruction market.
    
    The essence of PLF is giving first and asking for the sale later.
    
    You build a relationship as a trusted advisor (or even friend) before the transaction.
    
    deliver great value, and you do it in a way that makes the sale before you’ve even asked for the order.
    
    Six Keys to the Business Launch Formula
    
    Key #1: Always Deliver High-ValuePrelaunch Content in Your La
    unches
    
    benefits of creating hundreds or thousands of raving fans is far reaching.
    
    make no mistake—delivering real value in your prelaunch has a lasting effect.
    
    had people watch me through several launches before they were ready to buy.
    
    Key #2: Always Be Building Your List andBuilding Your Relationship
    with That List
    
    ability to write an email, send it to your list, and see the response within seconds will change what you think is possible.
    
    to even use the phrase “your list” is simplistic.
    
    your list universe, which will become the most valuable asset in your business
    
    moving someone from being a prospect to being a client will increase the value of that relationship more than almost anything else.
    
    they will be more likely to buy in the future, and they’ll be more likely to buy at a higher price point. T
    
    more likely to refer clients to you.
    
    Key #3: Make More Than One Offer
    
    In the midst of your first launch, you get at least one great idea for your next offer or product
    
    great deal of interaction with your prospects, and you’ll get lots of ideas and suggestions
    
    Often PLF Owners will do three or four launches per year and sometimes even more.
    
    sweet spot to be somewhere between two and four launches per year
    
    one or two of those launches have been big JV Launches (see Chapter 10) that dramatically build my list and make lots of sales.
    
    other launches are smaller Internal Launches that help me refine new offers and products before I roll them out as JV Launche
    
    Key #4: The Circle of Awesome: Seed to Internal to JV
    
    Seed Launch (see Chapter 9) is great for getting your first few clients, making sure there’s a demand, and creating a great product.
    
    take the finished product and do an Internal Launch to your lis
    
    Internal Launch will usually bring you much greater financial results than your Seed Launch.
    
    Prelaunch and Launch Sequences largely done and tested.
    
    results of a successful JV Launch are often exponentially larger than your Internal Launch.
    
    difference is that this time around you’ll have significantly more experience, probably a much larger list, and lots of happy JV partners who will be ready to promote your next JV Launch.
    
    Key #5: Relaunches and Evergreen Launches
    
    small class size kept the interaction level high, which meant he could charge a premium price.
    
    periodic relaunches,
    
    or you can use an Evergreen Launch.
    
    they will get to move through their own Launch Sequence based on when they joined the list.
    
    Key #6: Take Care of Your Clients and Launch to Them Again
    
    about FIFTEEN times easier to sell to someone a second time than it is to get a new client.
    
    over-delivering on my promises
    
    what you promised
    
    great customer support
    
    extra surprise or two along the way
    
    The Formula That Launched a Thousand Businesses
    
    series of launches that create their business.
    
    The list gets bigger, the offers get better, there are more past buyers to sell to, the JV partner support gets stronger.
    
- Chapter 12   Creating a Business You Love
    
    one thing to build a business—but quite another to build a business and a life that you truly love
    
    Any profitable business looks great when you’re struggling to pay the bills and put food on the table.
    
    you get to largely make up your own rules for the business, within legal and ethical boundaries, of course
    
    first step is to figure out what you want your business to look like …
    
    Your “Big Why”
    
    huge driver in my life is making a positive impact
    
    others who are driven to build a great team—to provide jobs and plenty of room for their employees to grow.
    
    At some point, there’s usually a higher purpose than acquiring more money and stuff
    
    I have a process to get my clients to their “Big Why,” and this is one of the most powerful exercises in the entire event
    
    Attract the Clients You Want
    
    people who resonate with your work, your products, your offers . . . and others who won’t.
    
    I know that during my launch process I’ll naturally attract clients who will end up being the kind of people that relate well to me.
    
    deep-rooted belief that I continually attract amazing people into my life.
    
    All of us have people we connect with better than others.
    
    that’s one of the jobs of good marketing—you want to attract the right people and repel the rest.
    
    first group was wildly enthusiastic—and they hung on every word I said.
    
    second group was attentive and respectful, but that was about it.
    
    couldn’t have been more clear—the people in the first audience were “my people.”
    
    difference in those conferences was the marketing that put the people in the room
    
    I tracked the people who became clients after those talks
    
    be sure you attract YOUR people into your business.
    
    Look through the Corners
    
    when you’re on a bike hurtling down a steep mountain singletrack, you don’t want to look at the trail directly in front of your wheel
    
    you need to extend your vision further down the trail
    
    you need to be looking further ahead than the next day or week or month.
    
    I see too many people continually compromise their positioning, their brand, and their reputation by chasing after the latest tactic or the last dollar
    
    take the long view (and these days, the long view seems to be anything past the next three months), then you’ll instantly stand apart in your market.
    
    I wouldn’t be where I’m at today if I hadn’t actively engaged in several mastermind groups since the early days of my first business.
    
    all about sharing, brainstorming, and holding each other accountable.
    
    Basically, one person presents an idea or problem they have in their business, and then the entire group does a big brainstorm about the idea.
    
    we all know it’s much more fun to solve other people’s problems than working on our own issues
    
    most powerful revolved around in-person meetings.
    
    I’ve also created high-end paid masterminds for small groups of my clients, which has given me deep insight into what it takes to create a great mastermind.
    
    It’s all about the quality of the people and the level of community in the group.
    
    everyone is there to focus on helping their fellow members, and they know their rewards will naturally come as part of the process.
    
    also need members who have the mental horsepower and the emotional intelligence to be able to contribute to the group at a high level.
    
    best masterminds have a strong ethos and an almost tangible sense of community.
    
    powerful sense of identity,
    
    feeling of “we’re all in this together.”
    
    When you get the right people and a great community, it’s pure magic.
    
    each member focuses on helping the others in the group, they can’t help but benefit.
    
    ideas, connection, and accountability
    
    The Most Important Thing in Business
    
    The one thing that makes all the difference? My answer was this: opportunity cost.
    
    opportunity cost is “the cost related to the next-best choice available to someone who has picked among several mutually exclusive choices
    
    what you have to give up when you choose between two or more different choices.”
    
    For an entrepreneur, the biggest opportunity cost is often time.
    
    Making the wrong choice can set you back weeks, months, or even years.
    
    chasing an opportunity has a greater cost than any financial expense it requires.
    
    You start to have success, you build up a series of assets, you prove your worth—and all of a sudden everyone wants to do a deal with you.
    
    opportunity cost: It’s like having a bookshelf that’s completely full
    
    Making the right decisions around that opportunity cost is one of the biggest factors in the success of your business.
    
    Don’t Be Too Cool for School
    
    going to have long-term success, then you need to be a perpetual student.
    
    Everyone at the top is a constant learner. You can’t be too cool for school.
    
    I spend a ton of time and money on my own education. I have to.
    
    one of the costs for great success is that you have to stay on top of your game.
    
    build strong relationships in your industry.
    
    think in terms of “partners” and “future partners.”
    
    more and more businesses becoming knowledge businesses, there are far more opportunities to cooperate than to compete.
    
    we don’t have to worry about splitting up the pie. Instead we work together and grow a much bigger pie.
    
    your network is your net worth.
    
    adding an information component to a business—either as part of the selling process or as part of the product—will become a huge part of almost every successful business.
    
    nearly every business should be in the publishing business at some level .
    
    it’s a lot easier to sell with the human touch
    
    they’ll still want to interact with a human
    
    corporate voice” is death to sales.
    
    PLF process is all about creating a connection and a conversation with your prospects, and communicating in a way that builds a relationship with your new clients
    
    Playing by Your Rules
    
    you’re in control.
    
    all starts with getting clear on what that business looks like and what your life would look like if you had that business.

    couple different job offers, but I picked Motorola mostly because I liked the location.

    exercise where I created my ideal life in my mind
    
    wrote down everything I wanted—income, lifestyle, material things, travel experiences.
    
    that list gave me the direction I needed
    
    Once my business started growing, I rapidly revised and added to the list.
    
    You can do this exercise for any time frame you want
    
    I usually use three years or five years from the present.

    Write down what your ideal life will look like in three years:
    
    Everything significant you create will first be created in your mind’s eye.
    
    Security of Being an Entrepreneur
    
    Lots of people who are thinking of starting a business worry about leaving the security of the paycheck world
    
    only true security is your ability to create value and get paid for that value
    
    one skill that pays off better than any other is the ability to market and sell yourself and your business.
    
    Sharpen the Saw
    
    take time away from work to recharge and refresh.
    
    there are always going to be some long days—especially when you’re starting out.
    
    If you owned a million-dollar racehorse, you would exercise great care in how you treated that horse.
    
    well-rested, carefully monitor its workouts, give it a clean, comfortable stable, and schedule regular checkups with a vet.
    
    your body is your million-dollar racehorse. Don’t you deserve the same care?
    
    how are you going to spend that one precious life?
    
    Working more hours is not the answer to your problems. You need to work better and smarter, and one of the keys to doing that is continually refreshing your mind and body. You need to sharpen the saw.
    
    We’re in the Himalayas
    
    happens to everyone whether or not they have their own business, but for most people the highs will get higher and the lows will get lower when they become an entrepreneur.
    
    friend Lisa Sasevich likes to say we live in the Himalayas—as entrepreneurs, the peaks and valleys are bigger than they are for other people
    
    be careful to manage our mental states
    
    if we’re running our own business, and especially if we have a team that’s depending on us, we need to be able to pull ourselves out of the funk.
    
    I keep a list of things that will pull me up when I’m not in peak state.

    You Can’t Get There Alone
    
    I didn’t hire anyone or use any contractors for the first 10 years I was in business.
